<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In submitting to the popular verdict this book,
which aims at being a plain, straightforward
account of the experiences of a young Australian
in the last great battles which have been fought
in Europe, I feel that a few words of explanation
are necessary.</p>

<p>In the first place, it may be asked why I have
allowed twenty years to elapse before giving
these reminiscences to the world. I must answer
that, as a hard-working surgeon leading a very
busy life, I had but little "learned leisure" at
my disposal; and I must also admit that I did
not feel myself equal to the literary labour of
writing a book. Indeed it might never have
been written if my friend Mr. Sandes had not
agreed to my suggestion that he should reproduce
in a literary and publishable form the language of
the armchair and the fireside, and so enable me to
relate to the world at large some of the incidents
which my own immediate friends, when listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
over the cigars to my recollections, have been
good enough to call interesting. So much for
the matter of the book, and also for its manner.</p>

<p>In the second place, military critics as well as
the general public may be inclined to wonder
how it was that a young army surgeon, a mere
lad in fact, should have been allowed to play
such an independent part in the field operations
at Plevna as is disclosed in the following pages,
and should have been permitted to move about
the battle-field and engage in active service, with
the apparent concurrence of the general staff
and of the officers commanding the different
regiments. In reply, I have to explain that the
Ottoman army was not guided by the hard-and-fast
regulations which no doubt would render
it impossible for a junior surgeon in any other
European army to act on his own volition and
carry on his work as he might think best himself.
Furthermore, I may mention that through
my close friendship with Prince Czetwertinski,
who was the captain of Osman Pasha's bodyguard,
I was always kept in touch with the progress
of the military operations; and I am also proud
to say that I enjoyed the confidence of Osman
Pasha himself, and was on terms of the closest
intimacy with that gallant and true-hearted
soldier Tewfik Bey, who won the rank of pasha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
for his magnificent courage when he led the
assault that drove Skobeleff from the Krishin
redoubts.</p>

<p>These facts may explain many of the adventures
narrated in this book which would be
inexplicable to critics accustomed to the rigid
discipline under which medical officers do their
work in other European armies.</p>

<p>It is only right to say, in conclusion, that
I consider myself singularly fortunate in my
coadjutor, who, while he has brightened this
narrative of my early adventures with all the
resources of the practised writer, has nevertheless
left the truth of every single incident absolutely
unimpaired. At a time when the Eastern
Question looms like a huge shadow over Europe,
and when the very existence of the Turkish
Empire is once more threatened, may I hope
that this story of the military virtues of the
Ottoman troops may not be found without real
interest?</p>

<p>People have often asked me how it was that
I, an Australian, came to take a part in the
defence of the Ottoman Empire, and to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
as a military surgeon under the Red Crescent,
which, as every one knows, is the Turkish equivalent
of the Red Cross of the Geneva Convention.
Red Cross and Red Crescent are alike the
symbols of a humanitarian spirit, in which philosophers
and students of ethics profess to see the
small beginnings of a future age of universal
peace; but as for me, I have seen how Cossacks
and Circassians fight, and I cannot help regarding
the future prophesied by the philosopher
as an impossible dream. When one has seen a
soldier of a civilized force sawing off the head of
a wounded but still living enemy with the edge
of his sword-bayonet, it requires an unusually
optimistic nature to believe in the abolition of
war and a perpetual comity of nations.</p>

<p>It was as the outcome of my <i>Wanderjahr</i>&mdash;the
sweet old German custom which sends every
young man roaming when he has completed
the technical training of his future avocation&mdash;that
I first smelt powder and saw the glint of
the Russian bayonets. The Wanderjahr of the
German seems to be an unconscious survival of
the nomadic instinct of primitive man&mdash;a small
concession, as it were, to the roving habits that
took his ancestors the Huns and Visigoths to
Rome. It lets a young man escape from the
fixed atmosphere of "staying point," as our
American friends call it in one locality, into the
"largior æther," the wider life of travel. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
here I must be excused for introducing a little
bit of necessary autobiography.</p>

<p>I must record that, after spending three years
at the Melbourne University, I went to Edinburgh
to finish my medical course; and having taken
my degree there, I was launched at the age of
one and twenty, as an expressive colloquialism
puts it, "on my own hook." Thus it was that I
began a period of wandering over Europe which
ultimately landed me in my ambulance at Plevna
in July, 1877. I need not dwell upon those early
travels, except to say that the allowance which
my father made me enabled me to go far and to
see much. Like Odysseus of old, I could say
that "many were the men whose manners I saw
and whose cities I knew."</p>

<p>After a run round Norway and Sweden, I
spent a few months in Bohemian Paris, and then
went on to Bonn, where I attended the clinic of
Professor Busch, and indulged in all sorts of
romantic visions under the shadow of the castled
crag of Drachenfels and the Sieben Gebirge.
Next I made my way down to Vienna, where the
sight of some Servians in their national costume
gave me my first glimpse into the romance of the
proud and chivalrous peoples of the Balkan States,
and fired me with a desire to see Constantinople
itself. During those months at Vienna I knew
my "Schöne Blaue Donau" well, and often
made excursions as far as Pressburg and Buda-Pesth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
looking forward to the day when I could
get an opportunity to follow the great water-way
down to Rustchuk, and so into Turkish
territory. But for the time being I got no
chance, and travelled instead through Styria and
Bavaria, finally turning southward, and finishing
in Rome.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I met a Spanish
surgeon, Senhor Garcia C&mdash;&mdash;, who was connected
incidentally with the events immediately
leading up to my appointment as a surgeon to the
Turkish troops. He was a delightful companion,
but improvident in money matters; and I hope
he will pardon me after this lapse of years for
disclosing the fact that he made me his banker,
inasmuch as it reduced me to such a low financial
ebb that, had it not been for his gold watch, I am
afraid I should never have seen the inside of the
Grivitza redoubt. I remember that he and I
put up when at Rome in a very fashionable and
exclusive "pension," to which I had been introduced
by a French count whom I met in Paris.
I was always regarded, perhaps on account of my
name, as a good Roman Catholic; and but for
an unfortunate little contretemps I might have
married into a princely Italian family there and
then, and never had to eat dead horse on a
campaign at all.</p>

<p>It was this way. Among the other residents
in the "pension" was an old Italian marchioness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
who had brought her two daughters to Rome
to introduce them to his Holiness the Pope.
She was kind enough to take a great interest
in me; and there is no knowing what might
have happened&mdash;the elder daughter was really
a charming girl&mdash;if it had not been for that
unlucky incident of the mutton chops. On the
second Friday that I was there an elderly
Scotch lady, who was a rigid Presbyterian, and
took no trouble to conceal the aversion with
which she regarded all Papists, ordered mutton
chops in the middle of the day for her lunch.
When I came in from a visit to the Vatican I
was very hungry. The chops were brought in,
and they smelt very good; so, as the Scotch lady
was late, I forgot the consideration due to age
and rigid Presbyterianism, I forgot my scruples
as a supposed good Catholic, I forgot that it
was Friday&mdash;and I ate them. Next day the
marchioness stuck me up in a corner, and asked
me how I could disgrace myself by eating grilled
chops on a Friday; she led me to understand
that I had deceived her, and she withdrew an
invitation which she had given me to visit her
and renew my acquaintance with her charming
daughter. Thus ended my first and last chance
of a dukedom.</p>

<p>After a few weeks in Rome, I began to get
seriously embarrassed from a financial point of
view. Garcia was a charming fellow; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was a poet, and, like all poets, he had expensive
habits. He even challenged me to a duel once
for laughing at some of his verses; but when I
threatened to kick him, he fell on my neck and
embraced me. However, my purse was not long
enough to sustain the two of us, and I was sitting
in a little café one day considering the position and
glancing idly over the <i>Times</i>, when my eye fell
on an advertisement announcing that the Turkish
Government had vacancies for twenty military
surgeons, and inviting applications. I read the
advertisement again with delight, and at once
determined to send in an application. Here was
a chance of seeing life with a vengeance. But
my spirits fell at once. I had only a few liras
in my pocket; and how on earth was I to get to
the Turkish Embassy in London? C&mdash;&mdash; was
in his usual poetic condition of impecuniosity, and
I was afraid to think how much he owed me.
But I could not afford to be chivalrous, or I might
lose the opportunity of a lifetime; so I tackled
him at once. He assured me with tears in his
eyes that he had not even the price of a flask of
Chianti in his pockets; but I was inexorable. I
pointed out to him that he had a very fine gold
watch,&mdash;it was really a remarkably valuable timepiece,
and had come down to him as an heirloom
from some haughty old Castilian grandee. I
impressed upon him that a gold watch is a most
unsuitable adornment to a penniless person, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
is moreover in debt, and I indicated to him a
means by which it could be converted into
currency of the realm. I think he felt it very
much, poor fellow; but it was not a time for being
over-scrupulous, and the heirloom of the Hidalgo
of old Castile was duly deposited with the Roman
equivalent for "my uncle" in a small and stuffy
establishment situated in a narrow street with
the suggestive name of the Via del Poppo. In
return we received twenty-five napoleons&mdash;it
was certainly an extremely handsome watch.
Garcia gave me enough to take me to Neuchâtel,
where I counted on receiving fresh supplies,
and I let him keep the balance. So I left my
Spaniard with a flask of wine before him in the
city of the Cæsars, and I never saw him again.
Peace be to his soul! He was intended by
nature for an Irishman.</p>

<p>I wanted to go through to Neuchâtel; but when
I got to Turin, there was a fresh difficulty to
be overcome. The Po had overflowed its banks,
and the railway was washed away, so that there
was no possibility of continuing the journey until
next morning. I had not enough money to go
to a hotel, so I walked about the streets of
Turin all night. Shakespeare has something
to say about people who</p>

<div class="poem">
wallow naked in December snow<br />
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat.<br />
</div>

<p>And as I wandered through the cold, dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
streets of Turin, I warmed myself by imagination
in the sunbeams that played on the gilded pinnacles
of the Seraglio and the marble towers of
St. Sophia in far away Stamboul.</p>

<p>At Neuchâtel I found supplies awaiting me at
the post office, and I hurried across to London
at once, where I sought out the late Mr. J. E.
Francis, of Melbourne, who was an old friend of
my father, and asked his advice about going to
Constantinople. "Go by all means, my dear
boy," was his cheery reply; "and I will tell your
father that I advised you to take the chance."
I had excellent credentials from my professors
in Edinburgh; and armed with a letter of introduction
to Dr. Forbes, who was the doctor to
the Turkish Embassy, I presented myself at the
embassy, and sought an interview with Musurus
Pasha, then the Turkish ambassador in London.
The ambassador was engaged; but I had an
audience with one of his sons, and two days afterwards
I was <i>en route</i> for Constantinople, with
£25 for expenses in my pocket, and an agreement
with the Turkish Government to perform
the duties of a military surgeon at a salary of
£200 a year, paid monthly in gold. They gave
me a letter to the Seraskierat, or War Office, at
Constantinople, and instructed me to report myself
there for duty forthwith. Among the other
nineteen selected applicants were two whom I
knew, one named Geoffrey, and a fellow named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Stephenson, who had been at Edinburgh with me.
Naturally I was in high spirits at my success; and
when I reached Vienna and looked up all my old
pals, we had a great day on the Danube on
the occasion of the first regatta held there, and
finished up with fireworks and other jollifications
in the evening. After a couple of days at Vienna,
we went through Buda-Pesth and Belgrade to
Bazias, where we took steamer and voyaged
down the Danube to Rustchuk.</p>

<p>What a magnificent trip it was! I knew the
Rhine pretty well while I was at Bonn: I remembered
the great stream that tumbled over the
falls of Schaffhausen beyond Mainz, swept along
past St. Goar and Bingen, the home of that
soldier of the legion who lay dying in Algiers,
down to Coblenz, where Marceau fell, and
Ehrenbreitstein, the great fortress that now no
longer frowns threateningly out towards France.
I remembered the castles perched high on the
beetling cliffs, and how strange the setting sun
used to look when seen through their deserted
windows. I recalled the haunted spot where the
Loreley used to sing, and the towering heights
of the Drachenfels, where the hills finally ceased,
leaving the river to broaden out and flow more
sluggishly between the low-lying banks down
to Bonn and to Cologne, and thence away towards
the misty flats and the grey distances of
Holland. But to my excited fancy, fired as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was by the prospect of being brought under the
spell and the glamour of Islam and of serving
under the Mussulman flag, the recollection of the
fairy-like beauty of the Rhine faded before the
dark grandeur of the river that was bearing me
farther with every revolution of the paddle-wheels
from European associations, and nearer to strange,
new experiences among the subjects of the
Shadow of God. At times we steamed through
fairly open reaches, and at times through seething
rapids, with the dark water swirling about the
bows, and the still darker cliffs rising till they
almost seemed to touch over our heads.</p>

<p>It was a two days' voyage down to Rustchuk;
and I shall never forget my sensations when I
caught my first glimpse of Turkish troops on
one of the islands in the middle of the stream.
Among my fellow passengers was a Mr. Jeune
(now Sir Francis Jeune). He had been out in
Australia as counsel in the Tichborne case, and
had met my father. When he heard that I
came from Australia, he took an interest in me,
and I found in him a sympathetic listener as I
confided my ambitions to him. Among the others
on board with me were Captain the Honourable
Randolph Stewart, a Queen's Messenger going
down with despatches to Constantinople, and
several of my professional brethren, including
Dr. George Stoker, brother of Bram Stoker,
Sir Henry Irving's manager, Dr. Simon Eccles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a well known London physician, and a Dr.
Butler, an eccentric old fellow who had been
in the Crimea. There were a number of pretty
Roumanian women on board too, and altogether
we had a jolly party.</p>

<p>At Rustchuk we took the train for Varna,
the seaport on the Black Sea which was our
point of embarkation for Constantinople; and
here I remember old Dr. Butler lost his ticket,
and the Queen's Messenger had to use all his
influence to prevent an angry little Turkish
station-master from "running him in." At last,
however, we were all safely on board an Austrian
Lloyd's steamer for the last stage of our journey,
a short voyage of twelve hours; and I got my
first insight into polygamous Turkey by discovering
an aged Turk who came on board with
his harem, a huddling little band of beauties
veiled to the eyes, who were housed in a sort of
canvas tent on deck, and at whose faces I made
several unsuccessful attempts to get a peep.</p>

<p>Next morning we saw Stamboul rising out of
the Bosphorus, and my dreams were at last fulfilled.
Fresh, as one might say, from Melbourne,
which forty years before was a camping-ground
for blacks, I saw before me in this gorgeous vision
of mosques and minarets, dark green cypress
groves, towers of gleaming marble, and gilded
pinnacles of the far Seraglio, a city of unknown
antiquity. The story goes that, more than three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
hundred years before the Christian era, the
Athenians, inspired by the burning eloquence of
Demosthenes, fought to defend it against Philip
of Macedon. One dark night, so the veracious
historians of that period tell us, the Macedonians
were on the point of carrying the city by assault,
when a shining crescent appeared in the sky,
disclosed the creeping forms of the enemy, and
enabled the beleaguered forces to repel the
attack with such vigour that the Macedonians
raised the siege and retired. Such was the
origin of the crescent which figures on old
Byzantine coins, and when the Osmanlis captured
Constantinople they adopted it as their national
device. It is a pretty story, and well&mdash;"si non é
vero é ben trovato." I saw before me a city
which had already been besieged twenty-four
times since its foundation and captured six times.
Among others, Persians, Spartans, Athenians,
Romans, Avars, Arabs, Russians, Crusaders, and
Greeks had besieged it before it fell at last under
the terrific assault of the forces of Mahomed II.
in 1453. I landed at Galata, the port of Pera,
which is separated from Stamboul proper by the
Golden Horn, and went straight up to Misserie's
Hotel, which is to Constantinople what Shepheard's
Hotel is to Cairo, one of the famous
hostelries of the world.</p>

<p>Next day we reported ourselves at the War
Office. We were shown into a room where four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
or five old pashas were sitting cross-legged on
divans, and we handed in our credentials. We
presented our respects through the medium of an
interpreter, and I was told to leave my address
and hold myself in readiness for active service at
once in the Servian war, which had then been
going on for about six weeks.</p>

<p>I was no longer a civilian. I was now commissioned
as a military surgeon in the service of the
Sublime Porte, and engaged in a practice which included
some three hundred thousand patients more
or less, of whose language I was entirely ignorant,
and of whose manners all previous impressions
had taught me to be suspicious. It is right to
say here, at the outset, that my experience of
over two years among the Turks proved to me
that the estimate formed of their character by
other reputedly more civilized nations was entirely
false and misleading. That there was a large
amount of corruption in the officialdom of Turkey
at that time was no doubt true; but the real
samples of national character, the men in the
rank and file of the army, I found to be simple-minded,
courteous, honourable, and honest in time
of peace, while braver men on the battle-field than
those who fought under Osman Pasha at Plevna
are not to be found in Europe. The magnificent
physique and robust constitution of the ordinary
Turkish private soldiers I believe to be due mainly
to two causes. In the first place they never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
touch alcohol, and in the second the traditions
of Turkish social life and the rigid guardianship
exercised over Turkish women have effectually
kept out the scrofulous taint which has so
appreciably affected the populations of other
European nationalities.</p>

<p>Having been gazetted at once as an army
surgeon with the rank of <i>colghassi</i>, or major,
which entitled me, among other privileges, to draw
rations for four men, I left the luxuries of
Misserie's Hotel behind me, and installed myself
in the barracks close to the War Office, with
a determination to see as much as possible of
Stamboul before we were ordered to the front.</p>

<p>There are few cities in the world where nightfall
makes such a difference as in Stamboul. By
day the surroundings of the city as well as the
city itself make up a kind of earthly paradise. I
climbed the tower of the Seraskierat, and gazed
with astonishment at the panorama which lay
before me. I saw two seas, the Black Sea and
the Sea of Marmora; two straits, the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles; two gulfs, the Gulf of Ismet
and the Gulf of Nicodema. At my feet lay
twenty different cities, the houses of which,
painted with the true Oriental love of bright
colours, nestled against a background of hills
clothed with patches of dark cypress and tall,
spiry pines. Before me was the spot where two
continents meet; and as my eye passed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
streets of Stamboul in Europe to Scutari lying
yonder across the mouth of the Bosphorus in
Asia, I realized how the tide of Eastern thought
had swept across the waters of this narrow strait,
and left its mark indelibly upon the strange people
among whom I had come to take the chances of
the battle-field. I knew too that across there in
Scutari was the burial-ground where the bones
of those English officers and men who died in
hospital after the Crimea lay buried, and I felt
that with the brave dead of my own race so
near me I was in good company. The old military
hospital at Scutari has been turned into
barracks now; but the room which Miss Florence
Nightingale occupied while she was performing
her mission of mercy to the wounded there is
still preserved untouched, while her name is kept
in affectionate remembrance by the sons of many
whom she nursed back to life, or whose last hours
she soothed with womanly ministering. As I
looked out upon the landscape, I saw it set in the
clear atmosphere of Southern Europe, so that
every separate minaret stood sharply out and
the marble domes of St. Sophia glistened in the
bright sunlight.</p>

<p>All is warmth and colour, life and brightness,
in Stamboul by day. By night, however, the
difference is appalling. The streets were never
lighted, and people were not supposed to be out
after nine o'clock. If one went out at all, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
went at one's own risk, and took the chance
of attack by any of the thousands of stray dogs
that prowl at will about the city and camp undisturbed
in the streets. To one who had been
accustomed to Paris and Vienna, where it is
never night in this sense, where gas and arc
lamps form an admirable substitute for sunlight,
and where the patter of feet on the <i>trottoirs</i> and
the hum of human life in the cafés are practically
ceaseless, the sensation of wandering through
these dark, deserted streets among hordes of
starving curs was a strange one. By day Constantinople
is modern, pulsating, alive. By night,
with those dogs about, it is like one of those
deserted cities of a long forgotten civilization, in
which Briton Rivière shows us the panther and
the tiger that have taken the place of man.</p>

<p>During my stay in Stamboul I often walked
through the bazaars, where solemn old Turks in
baggy breeches sought to swindle me with polite
decorum, and where the whole atmosphere
breathed of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. One half
expected to see Prince Camaralzaman come
swaggering down the street, with his scimitar
clanking on the pavement behind him; or Amina
or Zobeide, heavily veiled, and with only her
dark eyes showing through the <i>yashmak's</i> folds,
slide past demurely with a sidelong glance at
the stranger from the West.</p>

<p>The population of Constantinople do not believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in overwork; and for business purposes there are
practically three Sundays in the week&mdash;namely,
the Turkish Sunday, which falls on our Friday;
the Jewish Sunday, which falls on Saturday; and
the Christian Sunday. I went out one day to the
"Sweet Waters," a favourite picnic place near the
head of the Golden Horn, where the Turkish
women and children enjoy their holiday under
the trees, and the real Turkey lolly-men drive a
thriving trade in sweetmeats and sherbet. It was
curious to note how the veneer of Western social
routine was superimposed upon the changeless
institutions of the East. I saw the ladies from
the harems of sundry wealthy Turkish gentlemen
driving out to "Sweet Waters" in the afternoon
in carriages as perfectly appointed as any that
roll through Hyde Park or the Bois de Boulogne
in the height of the London or Paris season.
Two ladies from one harem generally occupied
one carriage; and the gigantic eunuch on the
box, who was responsible for them while they
were out under his charge, would use his London
carriage whip without hesitation on the heads
and shoulders of any young Turkish or Giaour
mashers who attempted to make eyes at the
closely guarded beauties.</p>

<p>I spent many a pleasant hour too in the long,
narrow <i>caïques</i> that plied for hire on the waters
of the Golden Horn like the gondolas of Venice;
but I still had much to see when, after a week's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
stay, an official communication was handed to me
informing me that I had been appointed regimental
surgeon to the Kyrchehir Regiment, so named
from the town in Asia Minor where it had been
raised. I packed my portmanteau at once, and
followed the messenger, who led me to the barracks
where the regiment was quartered, and where I
was introduced to my new colonel. He was most
polite, and invited me to have supper with him;
and then it was that I had my first really Turkish
meal. I cannot truthfully say that I enjoyed it;
and when my host, to mark the warmth of his
hospitality, picked up a piece of chicken off his
own plate in his fingers and placed it in my mouth,
I must confess that I almost spoilt all my chances
of a distinguished military career by an instantaneous
attack of nausea. I spent the night in
the barracks tossing sleeplessly on a divan, and
soon after daybreak marched down with my
regiment to the railway station.</p>

<p>The regiment, which was eight hundred strong,
was officered by a colonel, two majors, eight captains,
sixteen lieutenants, and a paymaster. When
the process of entraining was completed, I found
myself <i>en route</i> at six o'clock in the morning for
a destination of which I knew nothing, and in
company with a regiment of troops who were as
ignorant of English as I was of Turkish. I was
accommodated in a compartment with the colonel,
the two majors, and the paymaster, Mehemet Ali,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with whom I afterwards chummed up and lived
on terms of the closest friendship. It was
decidedly awkward, however, at first; for as the
Turkish officers could speak neither French nor
German, all communications between us had to
be by signs. The men were packed closely
together, and the train crawled slowly on towards
the terminus, stopping for one hour in every three.
We were three days and two nights on the
journey towards Tatar Bazardjik, and I had plenty
of time and opportunities for forming an opinion
as to the kind of men with whom my lot was cast.
I found that these men, who were all conscripts,
formed the second regiment which had been raised
at Kyrchehir, and fine fellows they were. I
could have picked fifty men from among them who
were as grand specimens of physical humanity
as could be found anywhere in the world. They
were all well clothed in the serviceable infantry
uniform, and were armed with the Martini-Peabody
rifle.</p>

<p>We camped each night at a railway station,
and I remember on the morning of the second
day seeing an old pasha who was organizing
troops locally come galloping down to inspect us.
Our regiment was paraded, and the pasha rode
down the lines scanning the men closely. Presently
he spotted me, and, seeing at a glance that
I was not a Turk, he addressed a question to
the colonel, who evidently replied that I was their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
new English surgeon. The pasha trotted up to
where I stood at attention, and addressed some
incoherent query to me; but as I could not even
conjecture what it was all about, I imitated the
gentleman whom Tennyson speaks of, and "smiling
put the question by." I thought that the
old pasha looked hurt; but the mystery was soon
cleared up by the arrival of his own private
barber with razor, soap, and brush. It seemed
that "side boards" were not allowed in the
Turkish army, and the small hairy appendages
which covered my youthful cheeks, and of which,
to tell the truth, I was rather proud, had deeply
offended the old pasha's trained sense of order.
So I had to submit myself to the pasha's barber,
and in a few minutes the offensive adornments
were removed, and I could no longer be distinguished
from any of my Turkish colleagues.</p>

<p>At last we reached Tatar Bazardjik at eleven
o'clock at night; and as there was no accommodation
at the railway station, camp-fires were lit, and
the regiment bivouacked for the night. Next
morning at five o'clock I was roused up, and the
colonel brought up four horses, giving me to
understand by signs that I was to select one
for a charger. I chose a little grey stallion, a
powerful animal, with a look of endurance about
him. He had a heavy Turkish peaked saddle
on him, a most uncomfortable thing to ride in
until one gets used to it; but there was no choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in the matter, so I had to make myself as comfortable
in it as I could. Then we started on the
march for Sofia, and a very unpleasant march it
was at first.</p>

<p>It was then the month of June, and the
weather was intensely hot; while, to add to our
discomforts, a terrific duststorm swept down on
us soon after leaving the bivouac, filling eyes,
noses, and ears with fine, impalpable powder,
and getting down the men's throats so that they
could hardly breathe. The regiment marched all
day, and of course I assumed that a good many of
the men would be knocked up; but at five o'clock
we halted, and pitched camp for the night, having
covered about twelve miles of the journey.</p>

<p>Soon after the tents were pitched I had my
first patient to attend. They brought up a man
who had all the symptoms of an ordinary fit, and
I had to make up my mind at once whether it
was a genuine fit or whether he was malingering
to avoid duty. It seemed to be a real fit, and
then again there was something suspicious about
it. I knew that if I was imposed upon at the
outset I should have endless trouble, so I took
my resolution at once, and explained by signs to
Colonel Suleiman, who was standing by, that the
man was shamming. The colonel's remedy for
cases of this kind was drastic, but very effective.
He had the patient sent to the rear, and given a
round three dozen with a stick on that part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
person which schoolmasters have found to be
especially suited for the receipt of chastisement.
Of course the word was quickly passed round, and
I had no more cases of fits to attend to during the
march.</p>

<p>I shared a tent with Mehemet Ali, the paymaster,
who turned out to be a really good fellow.
He was a little man with a very fair complexion&mdash;his
mother was a Circassian&mdash;and he had
twinkling steel grey eyes. He was the strongest
man I ever met. I had a horse, but I still wanted
a servant, so Mehemet Ali brought up four men
for my inspection. I chose a man named Ahmet,
an Asiatic Turk and a married man with five
children. He turned out a splendid servant;
but, poor fellow, he never saw his home again,
and his bones lie buried with those of many of
his countrymen on the banks of the Danube at
Widdin.</p>

<p>Next morning I was given to understand that
I should have to see a number of patients; however,
I fortified myself with two or three Turkish
phrases, and went my rounds without trepidation.
My diagnosis was in each case remarkable for
simplicity, and I asked few needless questions.
My first remark was invariably, "Dilli nitchika,"
which means, "Put out your tongue." If the
man seemed really feverish and bad, I remarked
authoritatively, "Hoiti araba," which means, "Go
to the waggon," and I allowed him to ride in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the waggon instead of route-marching. If I had
any doubts as to the genuineness of the indisposition,
I ejaculated sharply, "Hoiti balook,"
which means, "Go to your company." Of course
all the men who were really ill I made to take
two paces to the rear, and when my inspection
was finished I prescribed for them, and dispensed
my prescriptions from the well equipped regimental
medicine chest.</p>

<p>It took the regiment five days altogether to
march to Sofia, the colonel, the two majors,
the paymaster, an adjutant, and myself being
the only mounted officers. At first the route
lay through mountainous and very picturesque
country, heavily timbered with pines, beeches,
elms, and walnuts. The walnut trees seemed to
grow wild throughout the country, and the nuts
were in great profusion.</p>

<p>One night we stopped at the Bulgarian village
of Ichtiman, and for the first time I saw Bulgarians
at close quarters and slept in a Bulgarian
house. Dirt appeared to be the national characteristic
of Bulgaria, and a cheerful disregard
of all sanitary rules a leading feature in the
national disposition. For size and ferocity I
have never seen the domestic insects of Bulgaria
equalled; and in the brief armistices which occurred
in the unequal combats of that horrible
night, I longed for my clean and cosy quarters
in the paymaster's tent again. The Bulgarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
men are tall and fair, and the samples that came
under my notice wore huge bonnets of black
sheepskin and baggy garments of a kind of coarse
yellow frieze of their own weaving. Instead of
boots they wore sandals laced to the knee in
Spanish fashion, and their whole appearance was
grimy and forbidding to a degree. Most of the
inhabitants of the village disappeared into the
surrounding hills on our arrival, and the few who
remained forbore to present us with an address
of welcome or to erect a triumphal arch in our
honour. Sullenly and suspiciously they offered
us bowls of <i>yuoart</i> to eat, a horrible sticky mess
made of curdled milk, of which I partook to my
subsequent sorrow.</p>

<p>At last we came in sight of Sofia, the capital
of Bulgaria. It lay at the farther end of a great
plain dotted here and there with Bulgarian
villages, well watered by a river running through
it, and nicely timbered like a great park. Against
the dark background of the hills, to use a pretty
line of Tennyson's, "the city sparkled like a grain
of salt." Sofia was then a place of about twenty
thousand inhabitants, and the seat of government.
At one time the famous Midhat Pasha was the
governor of this vilayet.</p>

<p>The regiment moved in column of route along
the main road through the plain towards the
white houses glinting in the sunshine, every man
stepping jauntily as the close of the long march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
drew near. But Sofia looked better at a distance
than it did under our noses. At that time there
was only one hotel in the place, a filthy little
<i>cabaret</i> kept by a Greek, whose views with
regard to beds and meals were most primitive.
The railway runs right through from Stamboul
to Sofia and beyond now, and French cooking
has replaced the black bread and beans which
formed the Spartan fare placed before his guests
by that "base scion of a noble stock" who took
us in and "did for us" in '76.</p>

<p>The first English-speaking person whom I met
in Sofia was MacGahan, the war correspondent
for a London newspaper, and from him I learnt
at last where I was and what was happening
round us. We dined together, and he told me
how the Servians had been beaten all along the
line. I found that there were four other Turkish
regiments besides my own quartered in Sofia;
and among the English surgeons attached to the
troops I was glad to find an old friend named
Stiven, with whom I could exercise my tongue
at last after my enforced silence of the previous
week.</p>

<p>However, I was already able to speak a few
words of Turkish, and the paymaster used to give
me lessons regularly, pointing to the different
articles in our tent and repeating the Turkish
word for each until I had grasped it thoroughly.
I conformed to Turkish customs of course in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
everything, and soon accustomed myself to my
new surroundings. What strikes a new chum in
Turkey very much at first is the absence of
chairs. I never saw a chair there; but I soon
learned to sit down to dinner on my own haunches
on the ground with my brother officers. A
Turkish dinner was a curious meal. First my
servant brought me a basin of water, soap, and
towel, and I washed my hands, preparatory to
attacking the soup with my wooden spoon.
Mehemet Ali and I used to eat out of the same
bowl, dipping our wooden spoons in alternately.
The <i>pièce de résistance</i> was invariably <i>pilaf</i>, or
boiled rice, with little bits of meat cut up in it, and
sometimes scraps of chicken or turkey when we
could get hold of any. The pilaf was eaten with
the fingers; and the dexterity with which an
experienced Turk would fossick out a tender bit
of the liver, wing, or a satisfying "drumstick,"
from the superincumbent mass of rice reminded
one strongly of a digger unearthing nuggets in a
patch of rich alluvial.</p>

<p>It was astonishing at Sofia to notice the humane
way in which the Turks treated the Bulgarians,
who were to all intents and purposes a hostile
people, and who never lost an opportunity of
showing their hostility whenever they could do
so with safety to themselves. During the whole
of the time that I was in Sofia I never saw a
Bulgarian ill treated; and I think it only right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to emphasize this point, because, either from want
of knowledge or from that tendency to take
<i>omne ignotum pro malefico</i> which is so common
to mankind, the other nations of Europe have
contrived to affix the stigma of barbarous cruelty
to the Turks in such a manner that it is difficult
to remove or even to lessen the impression. All
I can say is that, as an unprejudiced observer
with ample opportunities, I never saw any
cruelties inflicted during a state of peace, nor
any punishments dealt out to Bulgarians except
in cases where they were fully deserved. The
Turk when under fire does not fight with rose-water
any more than the soldier of reputedly
more civilized nations; but if needless barbarities
were committed by both Turks and Russians
when their blood was up, one has to remember
the grim remark of the great Frenchman that
one cannot have an omelet without breaking a
few eggs.</p>

<p>It was in Sofia that I was called in to attend
my first lady patient; and the case is worth noting
as an illustration of the difference between Eastern
and Western methods of diagnosis. In Turkey
a practitioner does not get much to go on in
forming an opinion. A wealthy old Turk in the
town who had an extensive harem wanted advice
for one of his wives, and I was asked to call and
see her. I gladly accepted the opportunity, and
followed my guides, a couple of eunuchs, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
interpreter to a fine house, where they took me
upstairs and halted outside a thick, heavy curtain
reaching from the ceiling to the floor. Inside
was the harem, an institution which I had always
had a scientific curiosity to see, and at last I felt
that my ambition in this direction was to be
realized. A few low spoken words in Turkish
were whispered at the edge of the curtain by a
tall black-garbed eunuch, and then I heard the
rustle of draperies approaching on the other side.
A low toned colloquy ensued between the eunuch,
who seemed to be threatening, and my interesting
patient, whose accents had in them a touch of
plaintive entreaty. Presently a white and beautifully
moulded arm was shyly insinuated through
the space between the wall and the edge of the
curtain, while the eunuch bade me, through the
mediumship of the interpreter, diagnose the complaint
from which the fair one suffered and
prescribe a remedy. The hand was small and
finely formed, and above the wrist was a heavy
bangle of beaten gold. I felt the pulse, which
was fluttering and unsteady, and clasped the white
and tremulous fingers, feeling that with such slight
data to go upon any treatment that I could prescribe
would not be likely to enhance my reputation.
Accordingly I demanded to be admitted,
in order that I might see and question the patient,
whom I judged to be a Circassian or a Georgian
girl certainly not more than one and twenty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
probably pretty. A long debate ensued, in which
the eunuchs, the interpreter, and myself took part;
but all my arguments beat unheeded against the
rocks of their Oriental stolidity, and the logic of
the whole British Medical Society would not have
sufficed to persuade the principal eunuch to let me
see that unknown lady's tongue. With that thick
curtain between us, it was a case of Pyramus and
Thisbe and the wall; so I abandoned my quest
after the unattainable, and lost the only chance
that I&mdash;plausible Giaour though I was&mdash;ever
obtained of seeing the inside of a real Turkish
harem. Probably the lady was eventually treated
by a <i>hakem bashi</i>, or Turkish physician and
surgeon, many of whom are very clever in their
own way, or by a <i>jarra bashi</i>, a sort of "legally
qualified medical practitioner," who is recognized
as a person entitled to prescribe, but whose abilities
do not go much further than drawing teeth or
fixing up sore feet.</p>

<p>From Sofia our regiment pushed on to Pirot,
close to the Servian border, where we were
brigaded with two other regiments of infantry
and strengthened by a battery of artillery, our
mission being to defend the road into Servia in
case of a flank attack. We camped in the hills;
and as I had little work to do, I spent most of my
time shooting hares with the colonel's double-barrelled
gun, and also duck, which were very
plentiful. In the evenings I learned to smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the <i>narghileh</i>, and I also improved my scanty
knowledge of Turkish as best I could with the
aid of Mehemet Ali.</p>

<p>At last we got orders to leave, and at daybreak
we struck camp. The last that we saw of this
pleasant resting-place was the flame of our
burning camp-stables of brushwood, to which we
set fire before we started on our new march.</p>

<p>After a stay at Ak Palanka, we were moved on
to Nish, the headquarters of the Turkish army;
and here I met several English surgeons, who
had been despatched to the seat of war by the
Red Cross Society in England. Among them
was Armand Leslie, who was afterwards killed
in Egypt, in the rout and massacre of Baker's
poltroon levies while marching from Trinkitat
towards Tokar; and a couple of others, Litton
Forbes and Dr. S&mdash;&mdash;, whom I got to know very
well. At this time Nish formed the base of our
army, and the wounded were brought back to us
from Alexinatz, where the fighting was going on.
The first sight of those poor fellows, gashed with
sabre and bayonet, torn with shell, and riddled
with rifle-bullets, made me realize the actuality of
the conflict in which I was there to assist.</p>

<p>Life in camp was irksome enough; but I found
a difficulty in getting out of it, for while one of
our majors, Edhim Effendi, was a jolly, good-humoured
fellow, who was not above a glass of
liquor when he could get it, the other, Izzet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Effendi, was a dry, fanatical Turk, who spent most
of his time at his prayers, and always looked
upon me as an infidel. Izzet Effendi refused to
allow me to go into the town; but I appealed to
the colonel, and, having secured his permission, I
took up my quarters in Nish with S&mdash;&mdash; and
Litton Forbes. Then I was drafted to look after
the general hospital, and I left the regiment
altogether.</p>

<p>There were about twenty of us in all on the
surgical staff, and the hospital arrangements were
excellent. It was here that I performed my first
big operation, the patient being a Turkish
infantryman who was brought in from Alexinatz
with his knee shattered by a shell. He refused to
take chloroform, and I took his leg off above the
knee without any anæsthetic. He never said a
word, and went on smoking a cigarette all the
time. When the captain came round with his
notebook afterwards to take down the name, age,
and regiment of each wounded man, my patient
answered all the questions quietly and unconcernedly
while I was stitching up the flap of
skin over the stump. It was a marvellous exhibition
of fortitude, and a striking illustration of
the mettle of the men whom I was soon to see
charging with such splendid courage upon the
bayonets of the Russians.</p>

<p>At Nish I first met a young soldier whose remarkable
personality and singularly adventurous
life could not fail to attract attention, and with
whom I formed a close personal friendship, which
was only ended by his death barely a year ago.
Prince Czetwertinski, whom I first saw mounted
on a magnificent black charger in the main street
of Nish, belonged to one of the oldest families
in Russian Poland, and was himself the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the family. His mother had been living at
Lemberg in Galicia, and the young prince had
been educated in France, and afterwards at a
military school in Prague, with the object of
entering the Austrian army. At the last moment,
however, the Russian Government intervened,
deeming it unwise to allow a Polish prince, who,
though a Russian subject, was as hostile at heart
to Russia as were all his countrymen, to accept an
Austrian commission. The official world of St.
Petersburg set its face against Czetwertinski, and
refused to furnish him with the necessary papers;
so that when the Servian war broke out he
gladly seized the chance of taking service against
the Russians, the traditional foes of his Polish
house, proud still, although its glories had been
sadly tarnished.</p>

<p>Young Czetwertinski was well received at the
court of the Emperor of Austria, and was admitted
to the intimacy of Prince Metternich; but there
were grave difficulties in the way of the military
career upon which he had set his heart. At last,
however, through the kind offices of General
Klapka, the well known Hungarian general, who
was on friendly terms with the Turkish Government,
the young prince secured an entrance to
military life, and was appointed, not to a commission,
but to the grade of private in a
Turkish cavalry regiment, in which capacity he
had at first to perform the most menial offices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
When Alexinatz was taken in October, 1876,
it was Czetwertinski who brought the news to
Nish; and for his conduct in the engagement
he received a captaincy, and also the decoration
of the fifth order of the Medjidie. He was a
magnificent rider, and his victory over a vicious
black stallion that no one in the regiment could
sit was a good passport to the affections of the
Turks, who dearly love fine horsemanship. I
met him afterwards at Widdin, and got to know
him intimately. At that time he was captain
of a guard of eighty troopers attached to the
person of Osman Pasha; and the colonel of his
regiment, a man named Mustapha Bey, was
himself a Pole, who had fled to Turkey as a
boy, entered the Turkish service, and become a
Mohammedan. Czetwertinski fell ill at Plevna
of dysentery, and passed through my hands,
afterwards coming to live with me in the
Bulgarian house where I was quartered, and
bringing his servant Faizi with him. As the
young cavalry officer was attached to the person
of Osman Pasha, I was kept <i>au courant</i> with all
that was going on; and it was through him
that I was enabled chiefly to know and admire
the courage, the honour, the high military ability,
and the pure patriotism of the great chief under
whom we both served.</p>

<p>Czetwertinski fought with signal bravery in all
the engagements that took place at Plevna, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
on one occasion had his horse killed under him
at Pelischat&mdash;the famous black stallion that none
but he could ride.</p>

<p>He was afterwards selected for his knowledge
of French to act as <i>parlementaire</i>, and visited
the Russian headquarters in that capacity with
Tewfik Pasha. Before I left Plevna, Czetwertinski
was sick and wounded; so I sent him down
invalided to Constantinople together with Victor
Lauri, a German artist, who had chummed in with
us on the field. Had Czetwertinski been left
behind at Plevna, he would infallibly have been
shot by the Russians for a deserter, as Skobeleff
himself, who met him at a dinner party after the
war was over, assured him.</p>

<p>I said good-bye to Prince Czetwertinski, or, as
he used to call himself, Mehemet Bey, at Constantinople,
and lost sight of him, as I thought, for
ever; but years afterwards&mdash;it was in 1884&mdash;I
found a note at my house in Melbourne saying
that Mehemet Bey would call back in half an
hour. I waited to see him, and then he told
me his story.</p>

<p>It seemed that he owned some villages near
Odessa; but when they were confiscated by the
Russian Government upon the termination of the
war, he went to live with his mother at Lemberg
in Galicia. However, after the exciting scenes
amongst which he had lived, the dreary life of the
provincial Galician capital was intolerable to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
especially as the small revenue still left to the
family was miserably inadequate to support the
position of a prince. Accordingly Czetwertinski,
who was always an inveterate gambler, scraped
together about £3,000 and made for Monte Carlo,
with the hope of breaking the bank and restoring
his fallen fortunes. In three days at the tables
he had lost all but £25; and knowing that I was
somewhere in Australia, he went over to London,
and took a steerage passage in an emigrant vessel
bound for Brisbane. His fellow passengers were
such a rough lot that he would not associate with
them, and consequently he learned not a word
of English during the voyage, eventually landing
at Brisbane with one solitary shilling in his
pocket. He walked the streets of Brisbane for
the first night, nearly starving, and towards
morning heard a man speaking a few words of
French to another. Czetwertinski went up to
him, and found that the man was really a Frenchman&mdash;he
turned out afterwards to be an escaped
communard from New Caledonia&mdash;and that he
owned a small ten-ton cutter, with which he plied
up the coast, carrying provisions to the northern
squatters and planters. Czetwertinski took a
billet as deck hand to the escaped convict trader,
working for his tucker alone; but during his three
months' service on board he amassed capital in
a sense, for he learned English. His next step
was from the deck of the cutter to the schoolroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of a station, where he secured an engagement as
tutor in a squatter's family, who little guessed that
the quiet Mr. Jules who explained the irregular
French verbs to them with exemplary patience
was Prince Czetwertinski, the dashing light
cavalryman who made his mark at the taking
of Alexinatz a few years before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his mother in distant Lemberg was
searching Europe high and low for her missing
son, and at last she confided the story of his
disappearance to the Jesuits, by whom he had
been brought up as a child. Setting the
machinery of their vast religious organization to
work, the Jesuit fathers in Galicia sent inquiries
flying through the ramifications of their order in
all quarters of the globe, and at last their brethren
in Sydney discovered the wanderer, and placed
him once more in communication with his family.
They also offered him a post as master in a
Jesuit college near Parramatta, and it was during
a holiday from his duties there that he came
down to Melbourne to see me. His mother longed
for him to go home again, and sent him out
money, imploring him to return to Europe, which
he did soon after I saw him. I had letters from
him afterwards, in which he told me that he had
resumed his title of prince, and was living in
Rome with his uncle, who was a cardinal. He
had a special audience with his Holiness the
Pope, who took a warm interest in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>With revenues depleted by continual confiscations,
Czetwertinski found himself unable for long
to support the social position which he was called
upon to fill in Europe, and he accordingly
returned to Australia, and for three years held
a post as master at St. Xavier's College, near
Melbourne. I heard that he was a good teacher,
but very harsh with the boys. When he left the
school, I got him a post as tutor to the son of a
friend of mine at a good salary; but when he had
been there a week, there was a race meeting at
Flemington, and he got a holiday to come down to
town. Now Czetwertinski, though a magnificent
rider, knew nothing about racing; but he tackled
the ring with the same gay audacity as the tables
at Monte Carlo, and with £7 in his pocket
commenced a plunge in cash betting. His luck
was in this time, and he backed winner after
winner, leaving off at the end of the day £300
to the good. Two days afterwards I heard from
him that he had thrown up his billet, and was
leaving that night for Sydney, <i>en route</i> for
Bagdad or Havana! I surmised that he would
find his way back to Europe, and eventually
marry an American heiress with £20,000 a year,
with whom his mother had arranged a <i>mariage
de convenance</i> for him, with a promise that
£500,000 should be settled upon him on the day
of the wedding. As a matter of fact, however,
he got no farther than Batavia, where he opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a school, which was a failure. He worked his
way back to Cooktown, and thence in a state
of starvation to Sydney. On one occasion a
butcher's wife, who wanted to engage a tutor,
came across him in a registry office, and explained
to him that it was usual for people in her country
to wear collars. The poor wandering prince had
no collar, so he lost the billet. However, he
eventually made his way down to Wagga, where
he opened a school, which turned out very
successfully. He was doing splendidly, and
meditating another trip home, when he caught
a chill, and died in a week of pneumonia. A
Wagga man brought me down poor Czetwertinski's
final good-bye, saying that he thought
of me to the last. So died as noble, brave, and
high-spirited a soldier as ever drew the sword.</p>

<p>Nish, which is close to the Servian border, is
one of the most flourishing towns in Bulgaria,
and it was at that time fortified by several large
forts and earthworks. Many of the houses were
extremely handsome, and the villa in which we
were quartered was a beautiful residence. A
fine Bulgarian church and several Turkish
mosques lent stateliness and dignity to the little
city that nestles in the valley of the river
Moravia. In the evening, as we sat over our
cigarettes after dinner, there was a quiet restfulness
in the beauty of the landscape that had a
special charm; and when my comrades asked me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to sing, I would give them that sweet old song,
"Sweet Vale of Avoca, how calm could I rest,"
altering it to local circumstances by substituting
"Moravia" for "Avoca."</p>

<p>Routine comes to mould a man's daily life in
the Balkans as well as in London or Paris, and
before many days had passed we had settled down
to very regular habits. After breakfast at eight
o'clock, a walk of half a mile took us to the
general hospital, where we had a couple of hundred
wounded men under treatment; and after going
our rounds, and conferring with the head of the
hospital about any matters demanding immediate
attention, we were practically free by one o'clock
for the rest of the day. One day a week was
set apart for operations; but on the other days
we used to go out riding in the hills and to the
surrounding Bulgarian villages, with an occasional
coursing match&mdash;for hares were very plentiful&mdash;by
way of keeping our sporting proclivities properly
exercised. A very favourite trip was a ride of
seven miles out to a famous hot mineral spring,
where the water, strongly impregnated with
sulphur and chalybeates, gushes out of the living
rock in a stream over a foot in diameter at a
temperature of 120° Fahr., and falls into a natural
basin, largely resorted to by the residents as a
bath. Close to this bath, as the afternoon wore on,
the deep-bosomed, dark-eyed Bulgarian women
would bring the clothing of their households<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to wash, as Naus&#301;caa and her maidens used to do
long ago in the fabled land of Phæ&#257;cia, where
Odysseus, shipwrecked on his homeward voyage
from Ilium, was saved from the sea. The Bulgarians,
like their cousins-german the Servians and
Roumanians, are fond of bright colours, particularly
the women. Darwin throws the cold light
of science on the important subject of feminine
attire, when he points out that the gorgeous
plumage of certain birds has been developed by
them as a special sex attraction to secure for them
the notice of a mate. With birds and animals,
however, it is almost invariably the male who
decks himself out in the most brilliant colouring,
hoping thereby to make himself the cynosure of
all the eyes of the females; but in the human
species, by a curious piece of satire, Nature seems
to encourage the female to adopt this gentle art.
At any rate the Bulgarian women were adepts at
it; and in spite of their Finnish type of features,
many of them looked positively pretty as they
stooped over the pool in their short, white kirtles
of homespun frieze and loose-sleeved scarlet
bodices, making a bright note of colour in the
picture. And as they dipped their garments in
the steaming washtub of Nature's own brewing,
these rustic <i>blanchisseuses de fin</i> would sing the
plaintive folk-songs of their country in the smooth
Slavonian tongue, which had come to them in the
old migratory days, during their long residence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
on the Volga, before the Avars swooped down
upon them and drove them across the Danube
to the country under the shadow of the Balkans,
where they have remained ever since. In the
Bulgarian folk-songs, with their plaintive semitones
and their melodies sliding away invariably into
the mournful minor, one seemed to hear the
echoes of the history of the people who have
degenerated from the warlike race that crossed
the Danube under their great chief Zabergan in
the sixth century to the feeble and lethargic tillers
of the soil, who have grown up under their long
subjection to the great Byzantine Empire with its
seat of government at Constantinople, and afterwards
to the despotic Turkish power which
superseded it.</p>

<p>As the evening drew in we would race our
horses back across country to Nish, haunted by
the recollections of those plaintive Bulgarian airs
and of the low, rich voices of the dark-eyed
singers. The Turk, though an excellent fellow in
many respects, has peculiar notions in the matter
of voice production, and to hear a group of them
all singing in unison through their noses as they
squatted on the ground round a camp-fire was
an experience to which one had to get accustomed
before one could thoroughly enjoy it. It was a
pleasant variety to exchange the nasal tenor
squeak of the Turkish Tommy Atkins for the soft
contralto of a Bulgarian <i>blanchisseuse</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the principal sights of Nish is a squarely
built brick tower covered over with plaster, in
which are set three thousand Servian skulls.
This ghastly trophy, which is about fifty years
old, celebrates a long forgotten victory. The
heads were stuck there freshly shorn from the
shoulders of the Servians, and the whole grim
monument reminds one of those <i>sámadhs</i>, or
cenotaphs of heads, of which Kipling gives such a
vivid description in one of his "Departmental
Ditties."</p>

<p>Our party was joined at Nish by a son of the
Duke of Cambridge, Colonel FitzGeorge, and a
Captain James, who had come over with him from
Widdin. I bought a capital grey pony from
James for £8, and I always fancy that he imagined
I had got at him over the bargain. However,
<i>caveat emptor</i> is an admirable maxim in horse-dealing;
and the law presumably imagines the
vendor capable of looking after himself, as no
maxim has been framed for his guidance. At
any rate the grey pony stood me in good stead;
and in our nightly race home from the mineral
spring, or the particular Bulgarian village which
we happened to be patronizing with a visit, I
generally finished in the first three. It was a
flat race of course, for you can walk from one
end of the country to the other without meeting
a fence of any kind.</p>

<p>At night after dinner the entire British medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
staff at Nish, supported by FitzGeorge and
James, were in the habit of discussing the Eastern
Question in all its bearings, not from the outside
point of view of the unprejudiced observer, but
with the keenness of people who felt that they
had a close personal interest in the solution of
the problem. There were not wanting alarmists,
who took the cheerful view that, if disaster overtook
the Turkish arms, the exasperated Turks
would turn their swords against the Giaours in
their own ranks, and we should all get our
throats cut for our pains.</p>

<p>One of the speakers who invariably ranged
himself on the side of the minority in these
discussions, and whose chief delight it was to
be the Ishmael of debate with his hand against
every man and every man's hand against him,
was an extraordinary man named Foley, who
quarrelled violently with every one of us except,
I think, myself. Afterwards, just before the
Russian war broke out, the poor fellow met a
tragic end. He was quartered near Sistova in a
Bulgarian house on the bank of the Danube, and
it was found one morning that he had disappeared.
His fate was a mystery which was never cleared
up; and whether he drowned himself in the
Danube, or was knocked on the head by some
wandering Circassians, we were never able to
find out. Another of my comrades at Nish was
Ralph Leslie, a Canadian, who has had a fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
adventurous career, and was afterwards with
Stanley on the Congo. He was a nice young
fellow; but he used to read <i>Gil Blas</i> to me in
French when I was in bed at night and required
all my energies to circumvent the strategy of the
Bulgarian insects.</p>

<p>An incident occurred one afternoon which
came near terminating seriously for some of us,
and it forms a good illustration of the dangers
which the travelling Briton incurs as often as not
through his own pig-headedness. S&mdash;&mdash; and I,
with three or four more of the medical staff, were
walking down the main street in plain clothes
after lunch, when we noticed half a dozen
Turkish soldiers engaged in cleaning the street.
They were scooping up the liquid mud in great
shovels, and throwing it into a cart drawn up
near the footpath. A good share of every
shovelful of mud came down on the footway,
and as we approached S&mdash;&mdash; shouted to them
in English to "knock off" whilst we went past.
They either did not or would not understand,
and before we had gone three steps farther my
companion's Bond Street tweed suit received a
liberal baptism of black mud from the shovel
wielded by a dour old Turk, the ugliest of the
party. S&mdash;&mdash; lost his temper, and sent in a
heavy left-hander, which caught the old fellow on
the point of the jaw, and landed him kicking on
his back in the middle of the road. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
gang at once raised a yell, and rushed us with
their shovels, while we had to rely upon our
fists alone for our defence. Matters were
beginning to look very ugly indeed, when a
Turkish lieutenant who knew us rushed up, and
drawing his sword interposed himself between
ourselves and our assailants, who retired in
disorder under a vigorous volley of Turkish
maledictions. It was a close thing for us all the
same, and the adventurous career which I had
marked out before me came perilously near to
being abruptly terminated by an inglorious end
at the hands of an infuriated scavenger.</p>

<p>But this same S&mdash;&mdash;, capable man as he was
at his profession and good-hearted fellow to boot,
had an unhappy knack of getting into difficulties,
and his death resulted eventually as an indirect
consequence of a mysterious quarrel which he
had with a Turkish major under circumstances
which I recollect with great distinctness. While
we were at Nish, one of the British surgeons
attached to the general hospital, Howard Keen
by name, was quartered in a fine Bulgarian house,
which he shared with a Turkish major, whose
name it is not necessary to mention. S&mdash;&mdash; and
I went up to spend the evening with them; and
as it was a bitterly cold night with snow on the
ground outside, Keen advised me to stop with
him, and camp in his half of the house, which I
did. At about twelve o'clock I wrapped myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in my heavy military overcoat lined with wolf-skin,
and lay down to sleep on the floor in front
of the fire in Keen's room, while Keen also went
to sleep on his camp-bed. We left S&mdash;&mdash; and
the Turkish major drinking <i>raki</i> together in
the major's room at the other side of the house.</p>

<p>As the fire was burning low I woke with a
start to find the Bulgarian owner of the house
standing over me in a state of violent agitation,
gesticulating wildly and repeating again and again
some words of the meaning of which I had not
the faintest notion. He was holding in his
hand a revolver which belonged to S&mdash;&mdash;. I
guessed at once that something was wrong; and
fearing that S&mdash;&mdash; had got the worse for liquor
and insulted the Bulgarian's wife, I woke Keen,
who ran out in his shirt and trousers to the
other side of the house. I followed him almost
immediately, and he yelled out to me to come
to the major's quarters at once. I rushed in,
and found the major in a state of tremendous
excitement, chewing his big black moustache and
hurriedly buckling on his sword. Guessing that
S&mdash;&mdash; had got into trouble again, I sang out to
him to clear out; but as I did so the door opened,
and in he walked as white as a sheet. The
major drew his revolver, and fired at S&mdash;&mdash; point-blank,
but the bullet missed its mark; and before
he could pull the trigger again, Keen and I had
closed with him, and for about two minutes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
inside of that Bulgarian's sitting-room was about
the hottest corner I have ever been in. The
Turk was a big, powerful fellow, and he was
mad with raki; while Keen and I were both
tough, and in pretty good form. Over and over
on the floor we rolled, the Turk trying to throttle
us, while we hung to him like a couple of bull-terriers,
and gradually wore him out. At last
we had him fairly beaten, and, grabbing his
revolver, we blew out the light and fled, taking
S&mdash;&mdash; with us, and locking the door behind
us. S&mdash;&mdash; staggered off to his own quarters; but
when the morning came, he was found lying in
the snow outside his own door, and the exposure
brought on an attack of inflammation of the lungs,
from which he eventually died. In the morning
we tried in vain to find out the cause of the
quarrel; but neither S&mdash;&mdash; nor the major would
tell us. I think the Bulgarian knew, but he kept
his own counsel.</p>

<p>One night in Nish I met a very remarkable
Turkish officer named Ahmet Bey, who was
introduced to me as a man who had killed seven
Servians with his own sword during the final
attack upon Alexinatz. I never in my life saw
a man with such a magnificent physique. He
was very handsome, splendidly proportioned, and
of astounding physical strength. A few days
before I met him he had been the hero of
a feat about which all the troops in Nish were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
still talking. It seemed that Abdul Kerim
Pasha, the commander-in-chief, while inspecting
the troops one morning, casually expressed
a wish that he could capture a Servian prisoner
from the Servian lines. Ahmet Bey, who overheard
the remark, rode up, and, saluting,
asked to be permitted to get the commander a
prisoner. Abdul Kerim wonderingly gave the
required permission, and Ahmet Bey without
another word wheeled his charger, dashed the
spurs into his flanks, and galloped off in front of
the astonished detachment straight for the nearest
Servian outpost. As he approached the Servian
lines half a dozen rifles cracked, for the Servian
vedettes opened fire upon him, hoping to drop
him on the wing. But Ahmet Bey galloped on
unharmed, having deliberately marked down one
sentry for his prey. The sentry emptied his
rifle at the audacious horseman in vain, and too
late started to run. Ahmet Bey swooped down
on him like a sparrow-hawk upon a landrail, and
bending down grasped the man by the collar in
an iron grip and flung him without an effort
across the saddle in front of him. Then he
galloped back again, bending over his horse's
neck as the bullets whistled over his head, and
delivered his bewildered prisoner to the Turkish
commander amid the delighted shouts of the
whole detachment.</p>

<p>The hero of this extraordinary feat was afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
attached to the staff of Mehemet Ali Pasha,
in command of the army of the Lom. With the
same army corps was Baker Pasha, the famous
Colonel Baker, who was accounted one of the
finest cavalry leaders in Europe; and Baker
Pasha, who should be a good judge of soldierly
qualities, has left it on record that Ahmet Bey
was the beau-ideal of a soldier. Baker Pasha
has given it as his written opinion that he never
met the equal of this Turkish officer in instinctive
military knowledge. He seemed to be able to
divine the movements of the enemy and forestall
every change of position or modification of
strategy.</p>

<p>The frequent defeats of the Servians seemed
to indicate a speedy termination of hostilities; and
had it not been for the thousands of Russian
volunteers who flocked to the Servian standard
and took service under the Russian General
Tchernaieff, who commanded the Servian army,
it was evident that the resistance of Servia
must have collapsed much earlier. At last, when
Servia appealed to the Powers to stop the war
and an armistice was declared at the instance of
Russia, a large number of Turkish troops were
sent to the rear, and among them was my
regiment the Kyrchehir. We were ordered to
retire to Sofia, and of course I had to sever my
connection with the general hospital and rejoin
my regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>It was December. The sky was the colour of
lead, and the snow lay with a dead weight upon
the pine trees. The regiment started early in
the morning, and when I left for the long, solitary
ride to Sofia I was several hours behind my
troops. As I cantered my grey pony over the
frozen ground a mishap befell me at the outset,
for the gallant little animal cast a shoe, and I had
to stop at a Bulgarian village to get him shod.
Throughout the Turkish Empire they use flat
plates which cover the whole of the foot with the
exception of a small round orifice in the centre,
instead of the crescent-shaped horseshoes which
have come down to more civilized countries from
the Roman times, and I had to hunt up a farrier
to do the work. I found him at last, a surly, black-bearded
fellow, who gave free vent to his hatred
of the Turkish troops, and flatly refused to assist
me. Out came my revolver; and as I tapped the
barrel, significantly pointing first to the shoeless
hoof and then to the farrier's head, he came to
terms and consented. But when I remounted the
grey, I found that he was dead lame. The rascally
farrier, I discovered afterwards, had driven a
long nail straight into the frog of the unfortunate
pony's foot, and then nailed the plate on over it.
Before I reached Sofia a Circassian stole my
English stirrup-irons while I slept, and leading
my lame pony I finished the journey on foot.</p>

<p>However, we were a very jolly party at Sofia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
where a fresh lot of English surgeons chummed
in with us, and we all resolved to celebrate
Christmas in the proper English way by a splendid
dinner. On Christmas Eve a special sub-committee
was formed to arrange the details of a
banquet which should be worthy of the occasion.
We were going to have no more of the eternal
pilaf, with its accompanying hard biscuit and
gulps of hot black coffee, but a real hot joint, a
turkey, a goose, a plum pudding, and plenty of
wine. I went to sleep that night with my soul
filled with beautiful dreams of Christmas, and
peace on earth, goodwill towards Bulgarians, and
of roast turkey and celery sauce. In the morning
I woke, and learned with horror that the regiment
was ordered to march at once to the bleak,
detestable pass of Orkhanieh in the Balkans, and
that we should probably get no dinner at all.
They went away without me, and as Christmas
morning wore on I came to the conclusion that I
had better follow them or else I might get lost.
I did follow them, but I got lost all the same; and
after riding until ten o'clock at night I reached
a filthy Bulgarian village, and decided to camp
there. The house which I selected as the most
promising was about as clean as an English
piggery; but I found a kind of loft where maize
was stored in the cob, and there I stopped for the
night. I lay on the cobs of maize which were as
hard as paving-stones, and made my Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
dinner off one of them, hardly knowing whether
to curse or laugh at the irony of fate and the
"happy Christmas" which my friends in England
and Australia no doubt were wishing me. Next
day I overtook the regiment, and went into
quarters with it for five weeks at Orkhanieh.
I had plenty to do there, for the men suffered
greatly from dysentery; and as they could not
all be accommodated in the village, they had to
live under canvas, a mode of life which was very
severe at that time of the year. After a few
weeks there my stock of medicines, which was
never very large, began to run out, and I got
permission from the colonel to ride into Sofia,
a distance of thirty miles, to replenish the
regimental medicine chest.</p>

<p>Of all my campaigning experiences none were
more awful than those lonely rides from Orkhanieh
to Sofia and back again. My horse went lame
soon after I started, the cold was intense, and
in half an hour I was overtaken by a snowstorm
which nearly blinded me. All day my poor
horse hobbled along on three legs, while I was
afraid to dismount, knowing that if I once left
the saddle I should be frozen to death on the
ground. When I arrived in Sofia at ten o'clock
that night, I had to be lifted off my horse and
put to bed. In the morning my good horse was
found dead in the stable, killed by that fearful
journey. An Italian doctor, who drove into Sofia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
on the same day, was lifted out of the vehicle
dead. Perhaps if he had ridden he might have
been saved.</p>

<p>After a rest of two days, I had to start back
for Orkhanieh with my replenished medicine chest.
The prospect was not a pleasant one; but I faced
it with a fresh horse and renewed confidence.
Before I had gone half-way I missed the road,
and going across country came to a frozen river,
which I was afraid to cross, lest the ice might
give way and let me and my horse through into
deep water. Accordingly I rode along the bank
until I came to a place where I judged from the
colour of the ice that the water was shallow, and
there I resolved to attempt the crossing. When
I was in the middle, there was a crack like a
pistol shot, the ice broke, and we fell through
to the river-bed, my horse standing up to his
shoulder in the icy water, which reached to my
knee. I was off his back in a moment, and the
poor brute, after a couple of frightened plunges,
stood still shivering. It was plain that the ice
would not bear us, even if I could get myself
and the horse to the surface again, so the only
course open was to cut a way out. I took
my two heavy stirrup-irons, fixed them on one
leather, and, using this improvised implement
as a hammer, broke away the ice piecemeal, and
dragged myself and my horse up the bank on
the opposite side. At last I reached the camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as stiff as though I was encased in plaster of
Paris, and with my clothes frozen hard to my
body. It was three weeks before I properly
recovered sensation in my bridle-hand.</p>

<p>The regiment was ordered to Widdin before
I had recovered from that last ride, and on the
eve of our departure I had a severe attack of
dysentery, which weakened me terribly. However,
they lifted me on to my horse, and at last
we reached the town of Vratza, one of the most
picturesque towns in Bulgaria. Here I found
the Turkish regiment to which my friend Stiven
was attached; and to my great joy almost the
first man whom I met was Stiven, who was
living in the house of a Polish apothecary. I
was very weak and ill; but I accepted Stiven's
invitation to dine, and he prescribed a nourishing
diet with plenty of good blood-making wine.
What is more, he saw that I had it; and my
performances at that dinner, which was the first
European meal I had eaten since leaving Sofia,
made our Turkish servant open his eyes. I am
afraid to think how many bottles of the wine
of the country Stiven and I got through between
us; but I know that, when at last I tumbled off
to bed in the mosque where the regiment was
quartered, I slept the deep sleep of those who
have dined both wisely and too well. It was
a good prescription of Stiven's, and next day I
was completely restored in health.</p>

<p>A march of four days brought us to Widdin,
the journey being accomplished by easy stages
and with a fair degree of comfort. Of course
it must be remembered that there was no such
thing as a commissariat department in the
Turkish army. The <i>zaptiehs</i>, or mounted police,
in each district received notice of our approach,
and requisitioned the necessary supplies from
the farmers, who received acknowledgments of
Government indebtedness for the amount due.
We always sent forward a few <i>arabas</i> with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
advance party and a number of cooks; so that
when the regiment reached the camping-place
for the night all the preparations were made,
and a hot meal was ready for the men. We
usually camped in a Bulgarian village; and if
there was no other shelter for the men, we
appropriated the mosque, and made up our beds
in it. I have slept many a time on the paved
floor of a Turkish mosque, in the very arms
of Islam as it were; and I must candidly admit
that my slumbers were quite as refreshing and
my dreams as sweet as they have since been
within sound of the cathedral bells of Christendom.</p>

<p>Widdin is a town of considerable commercial
importance, and a strongly fortified position of
great military significance, being, in fact, one of
the keys of Bulgaria, for it is situated on a wedge
of Bulgarian territory, having both the Servian
and Roumanian frontiers almost under the
muzzles of its siege-guns. When we were there
the population numbered about fourteen thousand
persons, of whom perhaps one-half were Bulgarians,
one-third Turks, and the remainder
Levantines, Greeks, Italians, Spanish Jews, and
Tchiganes or Gypsies. There are a great number
of Jews everywhere throughout the Turkish
Empire, and they are very well treated by the
Turks. It is hardly necessary to say that almost
all the bankers and financial agents in the country
belong to this race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>There are practically two towns in Widdin&mdash;namely,
that which is within the fortifications,
and that which is outside. The fortified portion
faces the Danube, which forms its protection
for a distance of about one mile; and it is defended
besides by a high castellated wall fully
twenty feet in height, which runs right round
the town. Facing the Danube, when we were
there, were several powerful and perfectly
organized batteries, armed with at least fifty
Krupp siege-guns of the most modern description.
From the Danube side the town was practically
impregnable. On the other side, beyond the
castellated wall, was a wide and deep moat; and
over this was a drawbridge, which was pulled up
at six o'clock every night, so that after that hour
ingress to the fortified town was impossible
until the morning. Inside the fortress were the
principal public buildings, including the <i>konak</i>,
or townhall, the seat of administration of the
Turkish governor in charge of the vilayet, as
well as the barracks, which accommodated four
thousand men, a large Government mill for grinding
corn, and the great granaries in which a
reserve of grain was stored for victualling the
town in the event of a siege.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the population lived
outside the fortress in the different suburbs; and
beyond these again was the outer line of defence,
a huge wall of earth about twenty feet high, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
studded at short intervals with redoubts. Outside
this wall the country was low-lying and swampy,
capable of being flooded from the Danube, and
thus affording additional protection to the town.
One result, however, of all this circumjacent water
was that Widdin was one of the most unhealthy
towns in the whole of Turkey. The climate was
excessively damp, and we were never free from
malarial fever. At one time there were no fewer
than four hundred men in the hospitals with this
fever.</p>

<p>A staple article of export from Widdin is
caviare, which is obtained in enormous quantities
from the roe of the sturgeon, and sent away
packed in barrels on board the flat-bottomed
boats that ply up the river. I have seen a
sturgeon fully twelve feet long caught in the
Danube. Three men were dragging it with a
rope through the streets of Widdin. The town
has also a great reputation for its filigree work in
silver and gold, which is very beautiful.</p>

<p>In February, 1877, when our regiment reached
Widdin, we found about thirty thousand Turkish
troops in the place, mostly infantry, though there
were a few batteries of field artillery and about a
thousand cavalry. The Kyrchehir Regiment went
into quarters in the barracks inside the fortress;
but of course there was not sufficient accommodation
there for all the troops in the town, and
a military encampment was formed a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
miles out of the town for the bulk of the army
corps. Osman Pasha, at that time a comparatively
unknown man, was then commander-in-chief of
all the troops in Widdin, and Adil Pasha was
the commandant in charge of the camp. Osman
Pasha had already won considerable reputation by
his brilliant defeat of the Servians at Zaitchar;
but it was not until his subsequent successes
against the Russian arms that his name was
flashed through the length and breadth of Europe,
and that congratulations poured in upon him from
all quarters. It fell to my lot to open and read
many of the letters sent to him from England,
in which the writers, a large proportion of whom
were ladies, expressed their admiration for his
gallantry and begged the favour of his autograph.
Osman Pasha lived in a large house within the
fortress, and I myself was billeted in the same
quarter, where I lived quite in the Turkish fashion,
sitting cross-legged on the floor and eating my
food with my fingers.</p>

<p>At this time hostilities with Servia had ceased,
and a long armistice had been declared, during
which the Powers were occupied in dictating
terms to Turkey, which, however, she declined
to accept, her determined attitude in the matter
leading ultimately to the declaration of war
against her by Russia. The town of Kalafat
in Roumania is close to Widdin; and we could
see the Roumanian troops there busily engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in fortifying it in anticipation of hostilities breaking
out, and of an attack being made on the town
by the forces in Widdin at any moment. The
position, therefore, was decidedly interesting, for
we could actually see the Roumanians, who were
nominally our vassals, building up their redoubts
against us as fast as they could. It will be
remembered that during the early part of the
Crimean war the Turks occupied Kalafat, Osman
Pasha being the commander of the forces; and
that the Russians lost some twenty thousand men
in a vain attempt to take it.</p>

<p>The time of waiting in Widdin was fairly quiet,
although every one felt that war was in the
air, and that the interval of rest was only the
hush that precedes the hurricane. I had plenty
of work to do, for dysentery and lung troubles
affected the troops severely as well as malarial
fever. There were about thirty military surgeons
in the town including myself, but most of them
were Hungarians or Austrians; and the only
other British subject among them besides myself
was a man whom I shall call Dr. Black, although
that was not his name.</p>

<p>Dr. Black was by no means a credit to his
country. In fact, not to put too fine a point
upon it, he was a perfect disgrace; and as every
fresh scrape that he got into reflected more or
less upon me, I began to get heartily sick of him.
Few of the people in Widdin had ever seen an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Englishman, and Dr. Black's manners and customs
were not calculated to prejudice them favourably
with regard to the nation in general or myself
in particular. Fortunately for me there was
one other Briton in the town. To use a convenient
Irishism, he was a Scotsman, and he
was commonly known as Jack; in fact, I never
heard his surname. Jack was a high-class
mechanical engineer, and he had been specially
imported from Glasgow to take charge of the
Government flour-mill inside the fortress. He
lived there with his wife, a charming little Scotswoman,
and they both spoke Turkish like natives.
I had many consultations with Jack as to our
common <i>bête noir</i> Dr. Black; but we had to suffer
in silence for a while until the whirligig of time
brought its revenges, and Dr. Black was at last
turned out of Widdin.</p>

<p>I had met Dr. Black before in Sofia, and it
was with intense disgust that I came across him
again in Widdin. He was a middle-aged man,
who might possibly have been of some good in
his profession when he was younger; but he had
spoiled his life and ruined his chances with drink.
He was the most awful drunkard I have ever
met. In fact, he was never sober, and in his
habits he was perfectly filthy. He used to wear
a long, dirty overcoat, in one pocket of which he
invariably carried a bottle of the commonest
and vilest rum, while in the other he carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a loaded revolver, with which he would blaze
away at any one who gave him the slightest
provocation. On one occasion I saw him stagger
into a Bulgarian boot shop and yell out in English
to the proprietor, "Give me a pair of boots,
you &mdash;&mdash;!" Of course the Bulgarian could not
understand, so Black whipped out his revolver
and blazed a few cartridges away among the stock
in trade before the trembling cobbler could
pacify him. He was perpetually firing off this
weapon, and he was such a terror to the unfortunate
Bulgarians in whose houses he was
quartered, that he was never allowed to stay more
than a week at a time in one place. At last he
became such a nuisance that old Hassib Bey, a
most courtly old Turkish gentleman, who was
the head of the hospital, sent for me, and asked
me what on earth they were to do with this
compatriot of mine. I suggested that he should
be quartered in the military hospital, where he
would have fewer opportunities of being a
nuisance, and my suggestion, which was adopted,
speedily brought matters to a crisis.</p>

<p>One night, when Dr. Black had retired to rest
in the military hospital, drunk as usual, a number
of mischievous jarra bashis, dispensers and
dressers, began to tease him by hammering at his
door and making offensive remarks to him. He
yelled out to them in English that if they did
not desist he would bring out the inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
revolver; but they could not tear themselves away
from the fascinating sport of baiting a boozer;
and suddenly, as they were gathered outside in
the passage whistling, cat-calling, and shouting
out uncomplimentary epithets, the door opened,
and Dr. Black appeared in his night-shirt, revolver
in hand. There was a frightened stampede
down the passage, and as they fled Black emptied
the revolver at random at his assailants. A
piercing shriek told that one of the bullets at
any rate had gone home, and presently the whole
hospital was in an uproar, as a little Italian dresser
staggered into the house surgeon's room declaring
that he was murdered. A hasty examination,
however, showed that the bullet had entered a
portion of the anatomy where it could do little
harm, namely, the fleshy tissues adjacent to the
base of the spine, and no attempt was made to
extract it. Probably that little Italian dresser
carries the bullet about in his back still as a
souvenir of campaigning days in Widdin.</p>

<p>When Dr. Black put his head out of his door
next morning, he found a couple of soldiers
stationed there waiting to arrest him; so he
retreated inside the room again, and devised a
plan of escape. The window of the room looked
out over a courtyard about fourteen feet below;
and as there was a thick layer of snow in the
yard, Black decided to escape that way. He
knotted his blanket into a rope, and dropped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the yard&mdash;also into the arms of the sentry
stationed below. He was brought before old
Hassib Bey, who sent for me; and I sent for Jack
the mill engineer to act as interpreter. Finally
Hassib Bey decided that it would be no good to
put Black in gaol, and to my intense delight he
resolved to send him away out of Widdin altogether.
He treated my discreditable compatriot
most generously, for he had him placed on board
one of the large river steamers which plied once
a week from Widdin up as far as Belgrade, and
sent him away scot-free after his escapade, and
with <i>£</i>10 in his pocket to carry him out of
Turkish territory as soon as possible. I thanked
Hassib Bey for his forbearance, and to my great
joy I never saw Dr. Black again.</p>

<p>When my regiment was sent out of the fortress
to the encampment, I was detailed for hospital
duty, and took up my quarters at a small fifth-rate
Bulgarian hotel on the banks of the Danube.
The principal diversion was to go on board the
big passenger steamers, and hear the news of the
outside world and what people were saying of us
in England. I met a charming Frenchman on
board one of them, a highly cultured and agreeable
military man, named Captain Bouchon, who
was going down to Rustchuk. However, I
persuaded him to stop with me for a week, and
his society gave me the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p>The first war correspondent whom I met in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Widdin was a man named Fitzgerald, who came
out as the representative of the London <i>Standard</i>.
He was a fine fellow, and had seen service in
the British army. It was the month of April
when he arrived, among the first of the petrels
who presaged the coming storm; and about the
same time there came two battalions of Egyptian
troops under Prince Hassan, the Khedive's
second son. These made a strong reinforcement
for the large body of troops already in Widdin.
One day Fitzgerald came to me, and said that
he was going away up the river for a few days.
He asked me to look after his correspondence,
and to send any items of news worth telegraphing
to the <i>Standard</i>. He took the boat, and went
away leaving me in charge, and I have never
seen him from that day to this. I took up
his work, and sent several messages during the
campaign which followed to the <i>Standard</i>,
spending a considerable sum of money out of
my own pocket upon telegraphing. Afterwards,
when I got down to Constantinople and explained
matters to Mr. Frank Ives Scudamore, a
well known personality there, he refunded me
the money.</p>

<p>When the Egyptian troops arrived, they
naturally occasioned a good deal of stir, and they
were keenly criticised by their Turkish allies.
For physique and fighting qualities there could
be no comparison between the two bodies of men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the Turks easily carrying off the palm. Still, the
Egyptians were by no means to be despised.
Their officers were highly trained and intelligent,
and the equipment of the troops was new and
good, far superior, in fact, to that of the Turkish
soldiers. Moreover, the Egyptian force brought
with it an excellent band of brass and strings,
which proved a perfect god-send, as we had no
band among all the Turkish forces, and the
bugles were not particularly agreeable to listen
to. The Egyptians afterwards behaved well in
action, and many of them fought at the defence
of Widdin under Izzet Pasha, who successfully
beat off the repeated assaults of the Roumanians
and the Servians, and preserved the town
intact.</p>

<p>Among the many interesting men who were
gathered together in Widdin during this period of
waiting and watching was a singularly attractive
and talented Armenian named Zara Dilber
Effendi, who was a resident of the place and the
chairman of the local chamber of commerce. He
had been brought up in Germany, and spoke every
European language with equal fluency. I became
very intimate with him, and was a frequent
visitor at his house, finding him thoroughly well
informed and an intimate friend of Osman Pasha.
In fact, Zara Dilber Effendi and Osman Effendi,
a Turkish doctor who had been educated in Paris,
and who was the best surgeon that I came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
contact with during the whole of the campaign,
were my constant companions during my stay
in Widdin, as my medical <i>confrères</i>, with the
exception of two or three, had few tastes and
no ideas in common with me. Dr. Kronberg
and Dr. Busch, however, both capital fellows
and married men, were sociable enough; and I
have always attributed to the promptings of
Madame Kronberg and Madame Busch a brilliant
social idea which was developed by Osman Pasha
immediately after the declaration of peace with
Servia.</p>

<p>Civil and military society in the town was
convulsed one day by the announcement that
Osman Pasha intended to give a grand ball
to celebrate the cessation of hostilities and in
aid of the funds of the military hospitals. All
the arrangements for the ball were left in the
hands of Zara Dilber Effendi on the strength
of that gentleman's intimate knowledge of the
highest circles of European society; and as it
was generally understood that Osman Pasha's
invitations would be issued on the recommendation
of Zara Dilber Effendi, the feminine world
of Widdin was much fluttered. It leaked out
pretty early that no one below the rank of a field
officer would be invited, and we were kept on
the tiptoe of excitement until the eventful night
arrived. A fine Bulgarian house with a large
room was taken for the night, and for a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
week beforehand Zara Dilber Effendi was missing.
People said that he made several mysterious visits
into Roumanian territory, bringing back each
time a small army of Roumanian servants and
many suggestive cases and packages. It was
rumoured that there were to be chairs at the
ball, and knives and forks. People whispered of
a regular set supper, with European dishes and
champagne. But Zara Dilber Effendi kept his
own counsel, and went on his way, wrapped
in impenetrable Oriental secrecy. As for myself,
having received my invitation, I bought a brand
new uniform, wondering a good deal where the
ladies were to come from, and how the Turks
would enjoy a ball carried out according to
Western ideas. My invitation bore Osman
Pasha's signature, and I sent this interesting
souvenir out to my father in Australia afterwards.</p>

<p>When I entered the ballroom on that memorable
night, I was fairly staggered. The room
had been beautifully decorated by the Turkish
and Egyptian troops with festoons of flags and
picturesque devices composed of swords, rifles,
revolvers, and arms of every kind. Upon a
raised daïs, at the end of the room, stood Osman
Pasha in full-dress uniform, supported on either
side by Madames Kronberg and Busch beautifully
dressed. He received the guests with
courtly politeness, shaking hands with each as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
they came up; and as the long line of brilliant
uniforms sparkling with decorations, and of beautiful
women dressed with exquisite taste, filed past
in front of him, it was difficult to realize that
one was not assisting at some great State ball
in London or Paris, but at a function in a small
Bulgarian frontier town lying almost under the
guns of an avowedly hostile force.</p>

<p>A wide divan ran round the room, and on this
the Turkish officers sat cross-legged, observing
the proceedings with grave interest. The Turk
is quite used to paying people to dance for his
amusement, but he would never dream of dancing
himself. I watched one dignified old Turkish
colonel striving hard to maintain that decorous
impassivity which a few of the ballroom exquisites
of the Western world seem to have
borrowed from the East; but every now and then,
as some audacious young Giaour like myself
glided past clasping a vision of beauty all silk and
lace and pearls and flowers in his arms, I saw the
old Turk's eyes open wider and wider in spite of
himself. Zara Dilber Effendi had performed his
share of the work well, for he had collected about
sixty of the most cultured, refined, and beautiful
women that I have ever seen together in a ballroom.
There were a few Bulgarian ladies of
the highest class; but the majority were Spanish
Jewesses from seventeen to twenty years of age,
with the rich colouring, the dark hair, and liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
eyes of all their race, or stately Roumanians,
statuesque in type. There was a liberal sprinkling
of Levantines, Italians, Greeks, and possibly two
or three Servians; but though they differed in
race, they were alike in one particular, for all
were beautiful and refined. These ladies, I must
admit, were little short of a revelation to me, for
I had only seen a few thickly veiled Turkish
women in the town hitherto; but Zara Dilber
Effendi was evidently a person of some note in
Widdin, and the invitations had been sent out
to none but the ladies of the most aristocratic
families in the country.</p>

<p>I was the only Englishman present at that
remarkable ball; and I suppose it is not often
that an Englishman finds himself assisting at an
entertainment of such half-barbaric splendour,
and held under such dramatic circumstances.
Every man in the room knew that the commencement
of a fierce campaign was only a question
of weeks, perhaps days; and we snatched the
enjoyment of the hour as gaily as did the guests
at the Duchess of Richmond's famous ball in
Brussels on the eve of Waterloo. Indeed the
parallel between Osman Pasha's ball and the
historic ball at Brussels which Byron has celebrated
was a very real one. In both cases the
dancers were dancing on the edge of a battle-field.
In both cases the existence of an empire
hung on the issue of the coming struggle. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
both cases many of the brave men gathered there
amid the music and the flowers and under the
flags and lamplight were soon to be lying out
upon the blood-soaked plain, cold and deserted&mdash;the
<i>débris</i> of a dreadful festival. We had no
"Brunswick's fated chieftain" there that evening;
but the courtly old Turkish colonel who sat up
cross-legged on the divan, and watched me so
intensely while I danced, makes in my eyes a far
more vivid picture. I saw him afterwards, again
in a sitting posture, outside a redoubt near
Radishevo, when the tide of battle had ebbed
back, only to flow again in fiercer volume. His
head had fallen forward on his knees, and when
I touched him I found that he was dead&mdash;cut
almost in two by a Russian shell.</p>

<p>However, the shadow of the impending war
only served to throw the brightness of the ball
into stronger relief, and I gave myself up to the
business of pleasure with all the ardour of two
and twenty. There were only about a dozen of
us, mostly members of the medical staff, who
were dancing men, and we were consequently
kept busy. I generally divided one waltz into
three parts; and as the other men followed my
lead, we were able to give all the ladies a turn
occasionally, and there were no wall-flowers. A
big ambulance tent had been pitched in the garden
to serve as a supper-room, and we paid for the
refreshments as we had them, the money going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to the hospital fund. I used to take my partners
out after every dance, and the champagne corks
were flying almost as thickly as the bullets later
on. I recollect that I spent just £9 on suppers
and refreshments during the evening. A man
is not inclined to be economical when he knows
that before long he may have no mouth to put
champagne in and no head left to get dizzy with
it. Zara Dilber Effendi had got in a splendid
supper from Crajova in Roumania, where he also
obtained the favours for the cotillion which was
danced in perfect style under the direction of
the experienced Madame Kronberg and Madame
Busch.</p>

<p>Among my partners that night were three very
charming sisters, who had been born in Roumania,
but whose father was a Greek. They spoke
German very well, and consequently I danced
more often with them than with the other ladies,
with whom I found greater difficulty in conversing.
The sisters were good enough to take quite an
interest in me, and they invited me to call at
their house during the week, following up their
verbal invitation with a note next day. At the
end of a sheet of dainty little handwriting on
scented notepaper was a remarkable postscript
(I find that ladies generally put the most important
part of their communications into the
postscript) setting forth that their grandfather
had a rooted aversion to all Englishmen, myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in particular, and that he would certainly shoot
me if he found me calling on his granddaughters.
In campaigning times one is not discouraged
by trifles, and soon after the ball I called upon
my three charming partners, who entertained me
with coffee and music at their beautiful home.
Suddenly a step was heard on the stairs, and
the eldest of the sisters with a blanched face
whispered that it was their grandfather, and bade
me fly at once. I dropped from the window into
the lane below, and as I did so the irascible
old Greek opened fire on me with a blunderbuss.
Fortunately for me his anger had affected his
aim, and I escaped unscathed. A few years
more or less make little difference in national
proclivities. Old Lambro, the Greek pirate who
attacked Don Juan, is said by Byron to have
been "the mildest-mannered man that ever
scuttled ship or cut a throat"; and the grandfather
of my fair partners seemed to have
inherited something of the same temperament
with a certain difference.</p>

<p>In April of the year 1877 we began to realize
fully that war was imminent, and the Turkish
commanders set to work to prepare their troops
for a stern and fierce fight. Every day almost
the small, flat-bottomed, single-masted boats that
plied up and down the Danube kept arriving
with cargoes of flour and maize for victualling
the town, and also with reinforcements of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
troops, who were packed on board as close as
eggs in a basket. Most of the reinforcements
were quartered in the large camp, which was
pitched about two miles and a half out of Widdin
towards the Servian border; and when all had
arrived, we found about thirty-five battalions of
infantry there, with several batteries of artillery
and squadrons of cavalry, the whole making
up an imposing <i>corps d'armée</i>. As the camp
increased in proportions, it was found that more
surgeons were required, and I received orders
to give up my hospital work in the fortress and
report myself for duty at the camp. I was
appointed one of the ambulance surgeons, and
rejoined my old regiment, the Kyrchehir, which
had been sent out from the fortress. The camp
was situated on a long, green slope of rising
ground, several miles in length; and here the
long lines of bell tents were pitched, among them
the tent of my old comrade the paymaster, with
whom I once more foregathered.</p>

<p>About half a mile from the camp was a large
marsh or swamp, where great white arum lilies
grew, with jonquils, narcissus, and the different
kinds of iris, in magnificent profusion, as well as
millions of the tiny white snowflakes. I had a
trench dug outside my tent, and once a week our
two servants, the paymaster's and my own, went
down to the swamp, and brought back barrowfuls
of flowers, which I planted in the trench. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
too the orderlies made me a great seat of turf,
and every morning from six o'clock till half-past
nine I sat there among the flowers to receive my
patients, who used to come up from the different
battalions to have their various ailments treated.
Epsom salts formed a sovereign remedy for most
of the trifling sicknesses, and my method of
giving the physic was extremely primitive. As
I sat on my throne of turf, I had a sackful of
Epsom salts beside me, together with a bucket of
water and a pannikin; so that when the patient
had swallowed a handful of the salts I presented
him with a pannikin of water, and he washed the
nauseous mouthful down. The men never complained,
and accepted these simple ministrations
with exemplary <i>sang-froid</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule the Turks have excellent teeth; but
in such a large assemblage of men there were of
course many exceptions, and I had a good deal
of tooth-drawing to do. Some of those Mussulman
molars were dreadfully obstinate, and resisted
every effort of the Giaour with fanatical determination.
One man with a huge aching grinder
in his upper jaw came to me three mornings in
succession, for with the simple appliances at my
disposal I was unable to extract it in one sitting.
At last I made him sit down on the ground in
front of me, and, grasping the forceps in my right
hand, I braced my feet against the pit of his
stomach, and put forth every effort. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a crunching, grinding noise, a sound of breaking
and rending, then a "plop" as when a recalcitrant
cork comes out of a bottle of pale ale, and I was
lying on my back in the trench among the arum
lilies, with the forceps and the molar in my hand
at last. As for the Turk, he spat the blood out
of his mouth, piously remarked that Allah was
very good, and went back to his company.</p>

<p>If any of my patients were seriously ill, or
showed symptoms of malarial fever or dysentery,
which was very prevalent, I had them placed in
arabas, and sent back to the hospital in Widdin.
Then, when my work of inspection was over,
which was usually the case by about nine o'clock,
the rest of the day was my own, and I spent it in
improving my knowledge of Turkish and consuming
large quantities of coffee and cigarettes with
my brother officers. Every day the camp was in
a state of great activity, with never ending drills
and ceaseless inspections by the commandants,
who spared no pains to see that everything
was ready before the expected outbreak. The
discipline throughout the camp was admirable,
and the men were in excellent good humour.</p>

<p>Nearly every day I used to ride into Widdin
to hear the news, and return to camp in the
evening, generally reaching it before sunset.
Only life in a Turkish camp can enable one to
realize how deeply the Turks feel their religion,
and how diligent they are in the practice of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
devotions. No dour old Covenanter with a verse
of a psalm on his lips ever flung himself with
more dogged courage on the pikes of Graham of
Claverhouse, than did those Turks charge down
upon the Russian steel a few months later, with
the cry of "Allah" upon their lips and the
assurance of paradise in their heroic hearts.
Perhaps the best qualification for a good soldier
is to be a fanatic&mdash;as the next best is to be an
infidel. After "Praise-God-Barebones," the most
striking figure in a <i>mêlée</i> is Sergeant Bothwell,
who died "believing nothing, hoping nothing,
fearing nothing." Every evening at the camp
near Widdin the men were formed up in long,
double lines just before sundown; and as the sun
sank below the horizon the cry of "La ilaha
illallah Mohammed Rasul Allah" started at one
end of the lines, and was taken up by man after
man, dying away in the distance <i>diminuendo</i>, and
travelling back again <i>crescendo</i>, until it reached
the starting-point in a mighty shout of religious
fervour. The effect resembled nothing so much
as a <i>feu de joie</i> of musketry, delivered with the
precision and clearness attainable only by the
daily practice of a lifetime.</p>

<p>When the men were dismissed from this mighty
church parade, they would scamper off like so
many schoolboys, and indulge in all kinds of
games with the keen joy of living, and the unblunted
faculties of sensation which are seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
found in the alcohol-drinkers of other nations.
Wrestling was a favourite pastime with the men;
and it was no uncommon sight to see five
thousand spectators gathered in a huge ring, in
the centre of which picked competitors, stripped
to the waist, engaged each other in a catch-as-catch-can
struggle. Hassan Labri Pasha, one
of the principal officers in the camp, was an
enthusiast in the sport of wrestling, and used
to get up great tournaments in which the men
wrestled each other for prizes of tobacco and
other inexpensive little luxuries.</p>

<p>After three weeks of this life in camp, I was
ordered back to Widdin again, and took up my
quarters at the little Bulgarian hotel on the bank
of the Danube where I had been before. Things
were looking very serious at this time; and though
war was not actually declared by Russia until
April 24, 1877, still it was quite certain long
before this date that Roumania would espouse
the Russian cause; and when the Russian army
which had been quartered on the Pruth entered
Roumanian territory, the Government of the
Porte communicated with the Roumanian Government,
intimating that they construed the act of
Roumania in allowing Russian troops to cross
her frontier as an act of hostility towards Turkey.</p>

<p>About a week before the declaration of war,
two Roumanian officers came down the Danube
from Kalafat, and landed at my hotel, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
were stopped and told that they could go no
farther. One of them was a Captain Giorgione,
whom I met and asked to dine with me before
he went back to Kalafat. He accepted my
invitation, and after a long and pleasant conversation
about the general situation and the
prospects of war he gave me a cordial invitation
to go across the river to Kalafat and pay him a
visit in his quarters. As hostilities were expected
to break out at any moment, no one was allowed
to cross the Danube from our side without a
special permit from Osman Pasha; and as there
was no probability that he would grant me the
necessary permission, I determined to make the
trip on my own account. Possibly this was an
indiscretion on my part; but indiscretions are apt
to be the most enjoyable things in life, and I was
getting tired of the humdrum routine of the camp.
I had my English passport with me, which ensured
my safe conduct until the actual declaration
of hostilities; and armed with this precious document,
I got one of my colleagues to act as <i>locum
tenens</i> during my temporary absence from my
practice, and hired a boat and a crew of boatmen
to take me over the river, which at this point is
nearly a mile wide, and flows with a current of
extraordinary velocity. I dressed myself in a
suit of mufti, but had no hat, and must have
presented rather a piebald appearance with a
Turkish fez surmounting a suit of English tweed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
The Roumanian customs officers stared at me
pretty hard, but they franked me through on my
English passport, and I went into Kalafat, leaving
my boatmen on the Roumanian side of the river
to bring me back the same night.</p>

<p>I strolled into a café in Kalafat, which was
then a town of about three thousand people; and
the experience of living again in the European
fashion, eating at a table, sitting on a chair, and
seeing men in ordinary coats and trousers and
hard black hats, struck me with all the charm of
the unexpected. I felt the sensation of a Robinson
Crusoe transplanted suddenly from his desert
island and set down in the Hôtel Bristol.</p>

<p>Almost the first person that I met after I had
finished breakfast was my friend Captain Giorgione,
who expressed his delight at seeing me, and took
me off at once to introduce me to the general
commanding the division, after which I went to
the captain's quarters in a house in the town.
Most of the ordinary residents of Kalafat had
already left the place, fearing that the bombardment
of the town by the Widdin batteries was
imminent, and the houses were filled with
Roumanian officers and men. I lunched with
Captain Giorgione and his brother officers, many
of whom spoke German, and evinced a capacity
for hearing news which was hardly disinterested.
However, they were excessively polite, and in
the afternoon we strolled on the promenade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
listened to the strains of an excellent military
band.</p>

<p>As evening drew in my conscience began to
trouble me, and I had the qualms of a schoolboy
who has broken bounds, thinking of Osman
Pasha and the remarks that he would be likely
to make if he found out where I was. However,
my newly found friends would not hear of my
leaving them that day, and insisted upon my
staying to dinner, at which I was given the seat
of honour next to the general. What a capital
dinner that was! Perhaps I enjoyed it all the
more from the little circumstance that Osman
Pasha might have me shot as soon as I got back.
The Roumanian band played English airs in my
honour, and the officers kept my glass always
filled with Pommery. By the time we had
reached the walnuts I found myself developing
a surprising talent for mendacity, and the more
questions that my polite hosts asked me the more
astonishing grew my answering taradiddles. Of
course they tried to pump me as to the number
and disposition of the Turkish troops, and of
course, guileless youth that I was, I lied wholesale.
Even when I had put down the troops in
Widdin at a hundred thousand men and expanded
the artillery to four hundred guns, I was almost
as astonished at my own moderation as they
were at the magnitude of the force which Turkey
had already mobilized in Widdin. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Roumanian surgeons who was at that dinner
was green with envy when he discovered that I
ranked as a major in the Turkish army while
he was graded as a lieutenant. We had a very
merry night of it, and I hope that all the fibs
I told will not be remembered against me. Then
at daybreak I made my way to the river, found
my boatmen, and was back by six o'clock at my
hotel with no one a bit the wiser for my escapade.</p>

<p>I met some interesting men at Widdin just
before the war, notably a splendid young fellow
named Frank Power&mdash;who, by the way, was a
nephew of the late Sir Peter Lalor, once speaker
of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and long
ago a picturesque figure in the fight at the
Eureka Stockade near Ballarat. Frank Power
was a young Irishman, who had joined the
Austrian military service, but afterwards was
sent up to Widdin to act as war correspondent
for the London <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. He lived with
me; and I found him a most delightful companion,
full of romance, and generously endowed with
the love of adventure, and the enthusiasm, fire,
and wit which are characteristic of the best
Irishmen. He was a splendid rider and keen
all-round sportsman, had read widely if not
deeply, and with the mercurial temperament of
the adventurer he combined more than a trace of
the artist nature. He had the happiest knack of
producing charming sketches in black-and-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
or water-colours of bits of picturesque Bulgarian
peasant life, groups of Turkish soldiery, or
glimpses of the iris-spangled country that was
soon to be coloured in a deeper dye. Poor
Power was almost heart-broken when they sent
up Nicholas Leader from Constantinople to
replace him as the correspondent of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>. He returned to Vienna, and thence
to Dublin, where he resumed his old journalistic
life for a time. But to such a man as Power a
life of comparative inactivity was impossible; and
when the troubles broke out in the Soudan, he
soon found his way over there, and eventually
reached Khartoum, where General Gordon appointed
him British consul. Shortly before the
fall of Khartoum, Gordon sent him down the
Nile in a steamer with Colonel Stewart and an
Arab escort to take despatches to the force
advancing to the relief of Khartoum. However,
before the steamer had got far the smouldering
fires of disaffection among the natives on board
broke into flame, and they succeeded in running
the steamer aground. Lured by the friendly
demonstrations of the Arabs on the shore,
Colonel Stewart and Frank Power went ashore
with their escort while efforts were being made
to lighten the steamer and float her off again.
The full details of what followed will never be
known with certainty; but news of a massacre
reached the British column eventually, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
bearers of the despatches were among the
missing. Those who are familiar with Dervish
methods may picture for themselves the sudden
rush of bloodthirsty fanatics, the desperate hand-to-hand
combat, and the deaths of Colonel
Stewart and of my gallant young comrade when
they fell pierced by Arab lances on the scorched
and dreadful desert that lies along the banks of
the Nile from Wady Halfa to Khartoum.</p>

<p>Nicholas Leader, who was sent up from Constantinople
to take Frank Power's place in
Widdin, had already had an adventurous career,
and had smelt powder in many lands. After
seeing service with the British troops in Canada,
he resigned on the declaration of war by France
upon Germany in 1870, and took service with
the French arms. He was attached to the ill
fated army of Bourbaki, and was interned with
other prisoners of war in Switzerland. Afterwards,
when the Carlist insurrection broke out
in Spain, he joined the standard of Don Carlos,
and took part in the fierce guerilla warfare
which the Carlists waged against the Spanish
Government. The war correspondents of those
fighting days in Spain were as dare-devil a crew
as ever lived; and Leader described to me with
many a laugh the circumstances under which
he first met Edmund O'Donovan, another Irishman,
as gay and reckless as himself. Leader
was in command of a small fort in the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of Spain during the height of the insurrection,
when one day he espied a strange figure clad
in a long, dilapidated overcoat approaching the
walls. The Spanish sentries yelled to the suspicious
visitor to halt; and as he took no notice
of them, they fired on him, and the bullets kicked
up the dust all round the stranger. The only
result, however, was that he increased his pace,
and came on at the double until he reached
the walls off the fort amid a rain of bullets.
"Cease firing, ye blackguards!" he shouted in the
simple dialect of Southern Cork. "I'm Edmund
O'Donovan, and how the blazes can I get in
unless you open the gate!" Leader was summoned
to interpret the strange language of the
foreigner, and he let him in. Thus it was that
Edmund O'Donovan, who was attached to the
Government troops, walked alone into the enemy's
fortress.</p>

<p>Nicholas Leader, after all his wanderings, found
a grave in Turkish soil; for after a few weeks
in Widdin, he joined the army of Suleiman Pasha
at the Shipka Pass, and died there of fever.</p>

<p>About the time that Leader left Widdin the
town was in a state of suppressed excitement, for
every one knew that the declaration of war was
imminent, and the slightest incident was sufficient
to cause a demonstration.</p>

<p>Once I went with two others by boat to a small
island on the Danube, where there were numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of wild duck. We got to work upon them in
great style, and soon had a full bag; but when
we were in the middle of the fun, half a squadron
of Roumanian cavalry came galloping down to
the opposite bank to see what the firing was
about. It would not have taken much at that
moment to provoke a conflict.</p>

<p>Although we knew that war was coming, still
the actual declaration fell with the suddenness
of a bombshell. On April 25 I had done my
hospital work, and was walking down the street,
when I noticed a great commotion, and saw
groups of people talking excitedly together and
orderlies galloping about in all directions. Presently
Tallat Bey, a nephew of Osman Pasha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and one of the headquarters staff, came cantering
down the street. I stopped him to ask what all
the excitement was about, and he told me that
war had been declared by Russia on the previous
day. A regular hum pervaded Widdin all that
day, as the people repeated to one another the
ominous news that Turkey would have to fight
once more for her very life. We had been
arranging all our ambulance work beforehand;
and old Hassib Bey undertook, in compliance
with my request, that I should be attached to the
first troops that took the field.</p>

<p>But strangely enough, though war had been
declared, and though we could see the Roumanian
troops busily engaged in completing the fortification
of Kalafat, several days went by without a
shot being fired from either the Widdin or
Kalafat batteries, and we were left looking at
each other in grim expectation and suspense.</p>

<p>I remember well the first time that I ever
heard a shot fired in war. I was sitting in my
little Bulgarian hotel on the bank of the river
with Colonel Stracey, who afterwards commanded
the Scots Guards. He had been inspecting
the Russian army at Kischeneff, and between
the time that he left them and his arrival at
Widdin war was declared. When he came to
the hotel where I was staying, I was delighted
to see him, since he was the first Englishman,
apart from the war correspondents, the notorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Dr. Black, and my friend Jack, the engineer of
the Government mill, whom I had met in the
town. We were having lunch together, when we
heard a loud "boom" apparently close at hand,
followed almost immediately by the distant roar
of a heavy gun; and before we could realize what
was happening, a shell struck the end of the
hotel and crashed through two rooms, bringing
bricks and plaster down in all directions with
clouds of dust. The bombardment from Kalafat
had begun at last, provoked by a shot from a
Turkish gunboat on the river; and within a few
minutes the shells were shrieking over us, the
women were screaming, and valorous old Turks
were running out of their houses armed with
rusty flintlocks or anything in the shape of a
weapon that they could get hold of. Now and
then a shell came crashing into the hotel; and as
it stood in an isolated position on the bank of the
river affording a capital target for the enemy's
fire, it soon became too hot a corner to remain in.
So it was shut up, and Stracey and I, both of whom
were then under fire for the first time, moved
farther back into the town, where I had secured
a house for myself on the previous day in
anticipation of some such trouble. The firing
went on for about three hours, and all the women
in the town were of course terribly frightened,
and were rushing about shrieking and weeping,
not knowing what to do. It was curious to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the behaviour of the different nationalities in the
hour of danger. Most of the Spanish women
gathered together under the walls of the fortress,
where they erected a roof of mats with the
fortress wall as a support. Here they were
perfectly safe from the Roumanian shells, which
either struck the wall on the outside or else
passed over it, dropping much farther in the
natural course of their trajectory. The Turkish
women huddled together in two large alcoves in
the wall of the archway leading into the fortress,
refuges which were almost like dungeons hewn
out of the solid masonry, and which were
absolutely safe from projectiles. When the firing
was over I went to the hospital, and found that
four or five people had been wounded. A Spanish
boy had lost his arm, and a Turkish woman had
been killed by a shell bursting in her room. One
unpleasant result of the bombardment was that
Stracey and I had nothing to eat all night, as all
the butchers and bakers in Widdin were down in
their cellars, and no amount of money would
induce them to come out. They put their heads
above-ground next day, cautiously emerging like
rabbits from their burrows, but always went back
at night.</p>

<p>That evening when I was dozing off to sleep
there was a terrific crash of artillery, the vibration
of the firing breaking every window of the house;
and as it was quickly replied to by the batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of Kalafat, I jumped into my clothes, and rushed
out to find the cause of this sudden eruption of
hostilities. It was plain enough. A Roumanian
vessel loaded with troops was running the
gauntlet down the river in front of Widdin; and
as she steamed past in the night on the far side
of the long island opposite the town, the smoke
of her funnel betrayed her, and the earth-shaking
roar of the forty heavy siege-guns in the Widdin
batteries told that the attempt was discovered.
Only the vessel's smoke-stack could be seen over
the island by the sparks flying upwards in the
dark, and through this phantasmal target the
big shells hissed and shrieked in vain, bursting
in mid-air and burying the fragments in Roumanian
soil across the river. The batteries at
Kalafat took up the tale at once, and for a few
hours we had a lively time of it. It was the
adverse fortune of war for the Roumanian vessel;
for after she had dodged the storm of shells from
our siege-guns and got safely out of range, she
was blown up by a Turkish monitor lower down
the river, and every soul on board perished.</p>

<p>On June 1 I was detailed for duty in the
main hospital, which was just then receiving an
unusual amount of attention from the Kalafat
batteries. Unfortunately for the wounded, this
hospital was situated a few hundred yards from
one of our batteries; and while the Roumanians
were finding the range for this battery, a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
number of their shells, which had too much
elevation, dropped on the hospital and on the
surrounding houses. I was sitting in my room
in the hospital one day when a shell burst with
an awful crash in the middle of a ward full of
sick and wounded men. It struck the lattice
of a window, and at once exploded. When I
rushed in, the ward was full of dust and smoke,
out of which came terrible screams and cries.
Four of the patients had been killed on the spot,
and seven others had been wounded. One man,
who was delirious from malarial fever, had his
side ripped open from hip to shoulder by a fragment
of the shell. He was still alive, but wildly
delirious. Another had his arm fearfully mangled,
and I took it off at the shoulder there and then.
The only nurses that I had were the men supplied
by the different regiments for hospital duty.
One of them, a stalwart private from my old
regiment the Kyrchehir, was among the four
who were killed by the shell. A great outcry
was made outside Turkey about the Roumanians
violating the Convention of Geneva and the
principles of humanity by firing on the hospital;
but my own opinion is that they could not avoid
hitting it in the position which it occupied, and
that it should never have been placed there at all.</p>

<p>One strange and grim incident happened
during the bombardment, and, to the Turkish
mind especially, seemed to illustrate the doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of fatalism with appalling vividness. In the
height of the firing, when the shells from the
heavy siege-guns at Kalafat were dropping
incessantly within the fortress, one of them, as
it exploded, tore a great hole in the ground
large enough to contain a horse. A Turkish
woman, who was cowering with three children
under the shadow of the wall, determined to
take refuge in the newly made hole, reckoning
by the doctrine of chances that it was about
the least likely spot to be again disturbed.
Hardly had she crept in and drawn the three
children after her than another shell, leaving
the cannon's mouth at Kalafat nearly two miles
away, dropped into the very same hole and blew
the four hapless creatures who were hiding there
to atoms. On another occasion I saw a shell
strike the angle of a house, tear two walls down,
and reduce one half of a room to ruins. In the
other half of the room were a Turkish woman
and two children, all of whom escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>As soon as the war had fairly started and the
troops had smelt blood, the Circassians began to
display the wild courage and the love of pillage
inbred in them in the mountain fastnesses, which
they only left to become the troublesome members
of the Turkish Empire that they generally turned
out to be. Of their bravery and resourcefulness
there could be no question; but their rapacity
was inextinguishable, and no one who did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wear a uniform was safe from them. Soon after
the commencement of the bombardment, a party
of about fifty Circassians organized a private
raid on their own account into Roumanian
territory, and carried it out with extraordinary
dash and brilliancy. One dark night, when the
flash of the guns at Kalafat and the answering
stream of fire from the Widdin batteries illuminated
the blackness with fitful gleams of light,
the Circassians crossed the Danube in boats,
towing their horses behind them by ropes. They
had made ingenious lifebelts for the horses out
of the inflated pigskins which were used as wine
casks in the country, and thus equipped each
hardy little animal swam easily behind the boats
and crossed the river without mishap. When
the Circassians reached the opposite bank, they
removed these novel lifebelts, mounted their
horses, shot a couple of Roumanian sentries, and
galloped off in the darkness with the instinctive
knowledge of the whereabouts of plunder that
is born in the blood of hereditary cattle-stealers.
Before long they had rounded up a goodly mob
of the small black cattle of Roumania, and had
them headed for the Danube. The Circassian is
an expert stockman, and for the party to bring
four hundred cattle down to the river was an
easy task while the Kalafat gunners, blissfully
unconscious of the <i>coup</i> that was being executed
under their noses, kept pounding away at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Widdin fortifications. To bring a mob of cattle
across a river nearly a mile wide and with a
current of great velocity would need some skill
in daylight; but to bring them across in pitch
darkness, and under the guns of the enemy, was
a feat which few but Circassians could accomplish.
Those black cattle, however, that are found along
the banks of the Danube are almost amphibious,
and they take to the water like dogs. As soon
as the front files had taken to the water the
others followed them readily, and the Circassians
followed in the boats, rounding up the stragglers
with their whips, and towing their horses, re-equipped
with the pigskin lifebelts, behind them.
So in darkness and rain, across the hurrying
flood of the Danube they brought four hundred
head of Roumanian cattle, and left behind them
two dead sentries lying with their faces turned
towards the sky.</p>

<p>All that May the bombardment of Widdin was
continued at irregular intervals; but there were
occasionally several successive days on which
there was no firing, and at these times life in
Widdin was inconceivably dull. While these
voluntary armistices were in progress, we could
see the Roumanians hard at work constructing
new batteries, which made the Turkish troops
in Widdin chafe at their enforced inactivity.</p>

<p>Owing to the conditions under which the bombardment
took place and the strong fortifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of Widdin, the Turkish loss in killed and wounded
was remarkably small; for on June 27, after
several weeks of intermittent firing, we only had
about twelve killed and twenty wounded.</p>

<p>The Roumanian gunners seemed to have great
difficulty in finding the range; for on June 26,
when I was sitting on the verandah of the Austro-Hungarian
Consulate, all the Roumanian batteries,
six in number, opened fire apparently on the
consulate, though it was said afterwards that their
target was a Turkish monitor lying a little farther
down the river. The first two shells flew over
the consulate, the next exploded in the adjoining
house, and the next fell into the river about
twenty yards from where we were sitting.
Despairing, it seemed, of hitting the consulate,
my quondam entertainers, with whom I had dined
not so long before, directed their efforts upon the
fortress, but without doing any serious damage.
On the following morning they commenced operations
at seven o'clock, and from that hour until
three o'clock in the afternoon the screaming of
the shells was incessant. This was decidedly the
biggest day that we had had, and the Turkish
batteries responded very vigorously. Osman
Pasha took the keenest interest in the artillery
practice, and remained in one of our largest
batteries for the greater part of the day. While
there he told one of the gunners to direct his fire
upon a certain battery. The gunner fired three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
times, and on each occasion he dropped the shell
right into the Roumanian battery. Osman Pasha
was so delighted that he embraced the man, and
made him a sergeant on the spot.</p>

<p>In spite of the stunning noise of the projectiles,
many of which weighed sixty pounds apiece, one
soon got used to the cannonading; and while the
bombardment was going on, I often sat on the
battlements with my legs dangling over the side,
and watched the Roumanian gunners at their
work.</p>

<p>Our friends the Circassians, whenever they
found time hanging heavy on their hands, were
in the habit of relieving the monotony by private
forays across the river, during which they made
things very unpleasant for the Roumanian outposts.
Osman Pasha himself admitted that he
could put no reliance upon the Circassians. In
his treatise on the campaign, he sums up this
branch of his troops in one fitting sentence: "En
résumé, leur concours fut plus invisible qu'utile."
At the same time he points out that the savage
excesses of the Circassians were equalled, if not
surpassed, by the exploits both of the Cossacks
and the Bulgarians, who never allowed an opportunity
of massacre or pillage to escape them. At
the same time, while admitting the excesses of
the Circassians, he is careful to point out that
the regular Ottoman troops were kept in a
thorough state of discipline by their officers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
"We can affirm," he declares, "that the Turkish
regulars never committed an act similar to the
massacre of the defenders of Lovtcha, nor to the
inhuman treatment of which the Turkish prisoners
were the victims after the fall of Plevna."</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to give a brief
sketch of the plan of campaign which Osman
Pasha submitted to the commander-in-chief,
Abdul Kerim Pasha, about the end of June, and
which, had it been adopted, would probably have
changed the whole issue of the war. From the
official records, since collated under the Muchir's
personal supervision, it appears that Osman
Pasha proposed to the commander-in-chief to
leave about twelve battalions of infantry for the
defence of Widdin, and to unite the remainder
of the forces at his disposal, namely, nineteen
battalions, so as to make a <i>corps d'armée</i>, at the
head of which he (Osman Pasha) should leave
Widdin. He would pick up on the march a few
battalions from the garrison of Rahova, make
for Plevna, and there join the division of Hassan
Hairi Pasha, who would quit Nicopolis without
waiting for the enemy's attack. Then passing
Lovtcha, the whole column would march upon
Tirnova, where Osman Pasha would effect a
junction with the eastern army from Shumla
under Mehemet Ali Pasha, and then with the
two combined armies march in the direction of
Sistova. If this junction were prevented by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
movements of the Russian army, Osman Pasha
could occupy the position of Lovtcha, which was
better situated than Plevna for the defence of
the Balkan Passes.</p>

<p>However, Osman Pasha could not obtain leave
to carry out his plan, and he even encountered
opposition in making the necessary preparations.
His idea was of course to assume the offensive,
and hurl the Russians back upon Wallachia before
their reinforcements arrived, instead of being
compelled, as afterwards happened, to act on the
defensive at Plevna.</p>

<p>Afterwards, on July 10, the Sultan gave
Osman Pasha a free hand, but it was then too
late; and so it came about that delay at the
critical moment, combined with the incapacity of
Redif Pasha, the Turkish minister of war, who
was responsible for the defective organization of
the Ottoman army, its reduced strength, and its
lack of proper transport and commissariat services,
operating together, neutralized the brilliant
generalship of Osman Pasha and the devoted
courage of the men who fought under him.</p>

<p>On the evening of July 12 we heard the
news that we were to march next morning, and
every heart beat high at the prospect of an
early escape from the demoralizing inactivity of
life in the bombarded town. Among the troops
left in Widdin for garrison duty was my old
regiment the Kyrchehir; and on the evening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
July 12, just eight days before the first battle
of Plevna, I rode out to the camp to bid farewell
to my old comrades, from whom I was now to
part, for in accordance with my own request to
Hassib Bey I had been appointed to go on
duty with the troops about to take the field.
My relations with both the officers and the
men of the Kyrchehir Regiment had been of the
most cordial nature ever since I joined them in
Constantinople. They all expressed their regret
at the separation, which, I need hardly say, I
felt as keenly as they did. My leave-taking with
my little comrade Mehemet Ali the paymaster,
whose tent-mate I had been, and who had taught
me most of the Turkish that I knew, was specially
affecting; and I can say with truth that, as I
cantered back to Widdin that night to take the
field against the enemy, I carried with me the
good wishes of all my old comrades.</p>

<p>On July 13 at five o'clock we marched out
of Widdin, bound, as we afterwards understood,
for Nicopolis. Osman Pasha's army consisted of
nineteen battalions of infantry, fifty-eight guns,
and one regiment of cavalry;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> while Izzet Pasha
was left behind with the remainder of the troops
to garrison Widdin. I was attached to the
Shumla Regiment, which had the reputation of
being one of the finest fighting regiments in the
Ottoman army; and two other surgeons, Weinberger
and Kustler, both Austrians, accompanied
the advance guard with me. We said good-bye
to the others before we started, and we all drank
each other's healths, and wished each other
good luck in the unknown struggle that was
before us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The men of Osman Pasha's army were all in
splendid fettle, and were looking forward with
longing to the time of coming to close quarters
with the enemy. Since the close of the Servian
war they had all been well fed and well clothed,
the horses were in tiptop condition, and the men
set out upon the march with a light heart, carrying
each his seventy rounds of ammunition and
his accoutrements reduced to the lightest marching
order as if the weight was nothing. We had a
baggage train consisting of waggons full of ammunition;
but there was no commissariat service,
and we had to rely for sustenance solely on the
great army biscuits, each as big as a soup-plate,
of which every man carried a supply. Water
was obtained from the water-carts, which followed
the column in case streams or wells should fail
us <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>It was the height of summer, and the weather
was terribly hot when we started on the morning
of the 13th, the line of march following the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the Danube, though at some distance back,
this precaution being adopted for two reasons&mdash;first,
to conceal our objective from the enemy
and, secondly, to minimize the danger from their
guns.</p>

<p>The Roumanians of course were quickly aware
of our departure, and they followed us with their
field-guns on the other side of the river. When
they began to shell us, however, at Vidpol, we
diverged from the main road, and, striking farther
back, continued our march without sustaining a
single casualty. At five o'clock in the afternoon
the column camped near the village of Artzar,
and I rode into the village on a foraging expedition
to see if I could not supplement the biscuits,
which were very hard fare, and had to be broken
with a hatchet and soaked in water before they
could be eaten.</p>

<p>I managed to buy some <i>kabobs</i>, or small pieces
of meat fixed on skewers; and Weinberger,
Kustler, and I made a fire, and cooked a modest
supper, which we ate with the best of appetites.
We determined to camp about a mile away from
the main body, and tied our horses up to the
branches of a huge walnut tree, while we admired
the novel sight of the bivouac. The column
had halted in a wooded valley among the hills
and along the bank of a river; so that the lights
of a thousand camp-fires danced on the quiet
water, and the hum and laughter of thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thousand men came to our ears on the soft night
breeze that was whispering through the walnut
trees. Gradually one by one the lights died
down; the men, tired with the long and dusty
march, wrapped themselves in their great-coats;
and the camp was sunk in slumber. At about
nine o'clock it began to get very cold, and Weinberger,
Kustler, and I decided to shift our quarters,
and move in among the main body to warm ourselves
by the smouldering camp-fires. Picking
our way gingerly among the sleeping forms that
lay thickly on the bare ground, we came to a
water-cart, to which we tied our horses, and then
lay down to sleep. In the middle of the night
there was a tremendous uproar, and I woke with
a start, fancying that the Russians were upon
us; but the scare was groundless. Our horses
had pulled over the water-cart, broken their
bridles, and were galloping mad with fright
among the sleeping men; while the cries of the
sentries and the curses of the rudely awakened
sleepers speedily put the whole camp into confusion.
In the middle of it all Osman Pasha
put in an appearance to see what the noise
was about, and the disturbance ceased as quickly
as it began. With a few blessings from the
sentries, we dozed off again to snatch what sleep
we could, knowing that we had a hard day before
us on the morrow.</p>

<p>On the following day the marching was terribly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
severe, for the heat was intense, and the distance
we had already travelled had told on the men.
About half a dozen fell down from sunstroke, and
we had to leave them by the side of the road
on the chance that the arabas bringing up the
rear would pick them up. We came to several
small rivers which were not bridged and had to
be forded, while the roughness of the country
caused much trouble to the artillery. In many
places the path was so precipitous that the horses
had to be taken out, and the guns pulled up to
the summit by the men with drag-ropes. At
four o'clock in the afternoon the column reached
Krivodol; and here Osman Pasha received an
urgent telegraphic message from Said Pasha,
the Sultan's private secretary, instructing him to
push on with the utmost possible despatch, and
declaring that the Turkish Empire was then
between life and death.</p>

<p>In order that the fatal consequences of the
long delay in Widdin, at a time when every
moment was precious and when every Turkish
soldier was needed on the frontier, may be clearly
understood, it is necessary to take a bird's-eye
view of the disposition of the Russian forces and
their plan of campaign during those momentous
days in July.</p>

<p>As the Franco-German war opened with a race
to the Rhine, so the Russo-Turkish war opened
with a race to the Balkans, and the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
got there first. By July 5, while we were still in
Widdin, three Russian army corps had crossed the
Danube at Sistova, with a division of cavalry
and several Cossack regiments. General Gourko,
with a strong advanced guard, including infantry,
cavalry, artillery, and mounted pioneers, had
crossed the Balkans by the bridle-path of Hain-Bogan,
an exploit requiring extraordinary efforts,
and debouched near Hainkioj on July 14. Here
Gourko's dragoons easily routed a regiment of
three hundred Anatolian Nizams; but a single
Turkish regiment properly informed and properly
led could have barred the pass for days. On
July 19 the Shipka Pass was taken, a considerable
Turkish force was dispersed, and a panic was
struck at Constantinople. Meanwhile General
Krüdener, with the Ninth Russian Army Corps,
left Sistova on July 12, on the 15th invested
Nicopolis, and on the 16th received the surrender
of that fortress, upon which Osman Pasha
was then marching. Ahmed Pasha, Hassan
Pasha, with seven thousand men, were made
prisoners, and one hundred and thirteen guns,
with a large quantity of miscellaneous stores,
fell into the hands of the Russians. Had Osman
Pasha's propositions for an earlier departure from
Widdin been carried out, Nicopolis would probably
have been saved and the course of the
campaign entirely changed. It was the news
of the imminent attack on Nicopolis, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
communicated to Osman Pasha while we were
lying in camp at Krivodol, which caused him to
break up the camp after a few hours' rest and
push on with that terrible forced march to
Plevna.</p>

<p>We reached Krivodol at about five o'clock in
the afternoon of July 14, and bivouacked near the
village. It was a most picturesque little place,
dotted down as it were in the middle of a sheltered
valley which was watered by a little river. Here
and there in the valley I saw curious mounds of
earth about twelve feet high, and on inquiry I
found that these were the tombs of Greek inhabitants
who had settled here under the Byzantine
Empire. After a successful forage for eatables in
the village, I decided to bivouac on the top of
one of these tombs which had a small hollow in
the summit very enticing to a tired man; but
before I wrapped myself in my great-coat for a
sleep, the spirit of antiquarian research got hold
of me, and I resolved to investigate the contents
of my uncanny sleeping-place. By the offer of
a few piastres apiece, I got a dozen men from
my regiment with picks and shovels, and under
my direction they dug down into the tumulus
until they came to an old stone coffin containing
some bones, two pretty Greek vases, and a few
Byzantine coins. I left the bones in their place,
and filled up the tomb again, taking with me the
coins and the vases. The coins I afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
gave away, and the vases, which I wrapped up in
a sheepskin and tied to my saddle, were broken
by a little accident which occurred next night on
the march.</p>

<p>Before midnight the march was resumed, and
for the remainder of the night and all next day
the journey was continued, until we reached the
village of Veltchiderma late in the afternoon.
Weinberger and myself rode on in advance of
the column to the village; and I was so thoroughly
done up by the intense heat of the day and the
exhaustion of the march, that I made straight for
the Turkish khan or hotel, and after getting my
horse something to eat I fell fast asleep in the only
decent-sized room in the place. When I woke
up, I found Osman Pasha and his staff in the room
talking. I apologized for my presence, and he was
most good-natured about it. "A soldier sleeps
when he can, my boy," he said; "for he never
knows when he may get another opportunity."</p>

<p>After my sleep I went down to the river and
had a splendid swim, while the main body of the
column, which extended several miles in length,
arrived at the camping-ground. We were just
preparing to make ourselves comfortable for the
night, when I noticed that there was an unusual
amount of excitement about my regiment; and I
found to my disgust that an advanced guard
of about seventeen hundred men, including my
regiment, had orders to march right through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
night, and push on to Plevna with the utmost
possible speed. Osman Pasha had received news
by telegraph that Nicopolis, which was his objective,
had been taken by the Russians; and he
made up his mind to march straight to Plevna,
which was distant sixty-nine miles from Veltchiderma.</p>

<p>Oh, the monotonous horror of that march!
We were dead tired when we started; and all
through the dark night the men stumbled blindly
on, forbidden to sing or even to speak, lest they
might betray their presence to the scouts of the
enemy. Silent, sleepless, footsore, sick for want
of food, and faint for want of water, they marched
on the long road to Plevna. Our commander
was Emin Bey, and we had about fifty cavalry
scouts with us, but no guns. I rode behind
Weinberger, and at about two o'clock in the morning
his horse pitched head foremost into a deep
hole in the track, and I went after him. The
two of us with our horses floundered out of
the hole somehow or other, and we fortunately
escaped with a few bruises; but my archæological
treasures were lost, my Greek vases tied up in
the sheepskin were smashed to atoms, and all
my sacrilegious enterprise had gone for nothing.</p>

<p>Next night the men were so tired that we had
to camp for a couple of hours in the open plain,
as they could positively go no farther without a
rest. My horse had had hardly anything to eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
all day; so I rode away a hundred yards from the
main body to a place where there was some good
grass, and decided to let him have a feed. I tied
the reins round my wrist, and went to sleep on
the open plain. When I woke up all was silent,
for the troops had gone, and so had my horse,
while I knew that the country all round was
swarming with Cossacks. It was not a nice predicament
to be in; but luckily my horse, a beautiful
little Arab stallion and very quiet, had not
strayed far, and I easily caught and mounted him.
Then I went in pursuit of the troops, and by a
combination of luck and judgment I found them
before I had ridden many miles.</p>

<p>We lost half a dozen men next day from sunstroke;
and I could do nothing to save the poor
fellows, who simply dropped in their tracks, and
had to be left to die at the side of the road.
We had hardly any water, and the men suffered
terribly, the feet of numbers of them being quite
raw with continual marching. I bound up their
feet as well as I could with linen and old rags,
but the men who wore sandals were much better
off than those who wore boots; and the severity
of the march may be guessed from the fact
that, while the advanced guard consisted of one
thousand seven hundred men when it started,
there remained only one thousand three hundred
when it reached Plevna. The others had dropped
out on the way, and those that remained alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
were picked up by the waggons following the
main body behind us.</p>

<p>That afternoon we crossed the river Isker, the
men wading through the water, which reached to
their shoulders. Weinberger and I found that
the troops were to halt for a couple of hours near
a Bulgarian village, and we rode in to see if we
could not get something to eat. Since leaving
Widdin we had eaten nothing but a handful of
kabobs, some maize plucked in the fields, and
our hard biscuits.</p>

<p>The first thing that attracted my attention as
I rode into that village was a flock of geese,
and I remember saying to Weinberger, "Look
here; I don't know what you are going to do,
but I am going to have a goose for dinner."
We saw a Bulgarian, who was evidently the
proprietor of the geese; and Weinberger, who
spoke Bulgarian fluently, opened <i>pourparlers</i> on
the subject, and offered a medjidie apiece for
two of the birds. The Bulgarian was obdurate,
and refused to sell at any price. We talked to
him politely, we urged the claims of hospitality,
and we descanted upon the high price which we
were prepared to give, but all to no purpose.
The idea of losing a splendid dinner which was
already practically in my grasp enraged me, and
I made Weinberger cover the Bulgarian with his
revolver while I secured the materials for a meal.
With the revolver barrel levelled at his head, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Bulgarian was obliged to watch me sulkily as I
chased the flock of geese with my drawn sword.
The blade was as keen as a razor, and with a
couple of swishing strokes I smote off the heads
of two of the birds. We plucked them, cleaned
them, and roasted them; Weinberger ate one,
and I ate the other.</p>

<p>When we had finished this hearty meal, we
found that the troops had gone on; so we rode
after them, and travelled right through the night,
finding ourselves next morning about four miles
from Plevna. This was the sixth day after
leaving Widdin, and we had done one hundred
and twenty miles altogether, having covered the
last seventy miles in three nights and two days
of almost continuous marching&mdash;a feat which will
bear comparison with the greatest forced marches
on record. The men had subsisted on two
biscuits per day with a very small allowance of
water, and each man had carried seventy rounds
of ammunition as well as his accoutrements. Few
of them, moreover, had received a single penny
of pay for the past twelve months, and yet they
stuck to their work with indomitable pluck and
good humour.</p>

<p>When we reached the bridge across the Vid,
about three miles from our destination, on the
morning of July 18, the column could go no
farther, and we halted for the last time in sight
of the minarets of Plevna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Alouf Pasha with three battalions had been
in the town for some time, and Osman Pasha
had sent us on in advance to assist him in holding
Plevna until the main body could arrive.</p>

<p>When I rode into Plevna at eleven o'clock
in the morning of July 18, I went straight to
a khan and had a Turkish bath, after which I
sallied out to survey the town.</p>

<p>The town of Plevna is built in the valley of the
Tutchenitza, a small affluent of the Vid, about
three miles from the meeting of the two, and
just south of the confluence of the former with
the Grivitza, which gave its name to the celebrated
Grivitza redoubt. Before the war Plevna
contained about seventeen thousand inhabitants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
eight mosques, and two Christian churches. All
round the angle formed by the confluence of
the Grivitza and Tutchenitza are rolling hills,
rising to their highest on the north near the
villages of Opanetz, Bukova, and Grivitza. To
the east one could see a number of small isolated
hills, forming natural mamelons; and on the south
a huge natural rampart defends the town. On
the left bank of the Tutchenitza rise a succession
of knolls, which were called by the Russians the
"Green Hills"; and here some of the heaviest
of the fighting afterwards took place.</p>

<p>When we of the advance guard arrived at
Plevna on the morning of July 18, the uncut
maize stood high on the hill-slopes round the
town, and in places even a cavalry trooper
might be hidden. The Green Hills were
covered with vineyards, and there was plenty
of timber, consisting mostly of oaks and beeches,
which speedily vanished as the campaign progressed,
until the hills were desolate in their
absolute bareness. When Osman Pasha arrived,
the fortifications consisted of a single blockhouse,
between the Vid and the Tutchenitza on the
Sofia road, of the kind which one saw all along
the Servian and Albanian frontiers. The position,
however, offered splendid opportunities for
defence, enclosed as it was on three sides by
hills, which afforded admirable sites for defensive
works, hiding the interior and allowing reserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to be concentrated out of sight ready to be
directed on any threatened point. The deep
ravines which break up the country and for
the most part converge on Plevna rendered the
lateral communication of the attacking force very
difficult, so that the tactical contact, which is so
important to the success of a combined attack
on two points, was scarcely possible. It was
easy to see that the ground was difficult for the
movements of cavalry and guns; and the maize,
vineyards, and scrub combined to prevent the
rapid movement even of infantry.</p>

<p>In a short but highly suggestive sketch entitled
<i>Le Petit Village</i>, Zola describes a modest
little hamlet, nestling in a valley, remote from
the busy world outside, and screened by a curtain
of closely planted poplars from the eyes of
curious strangers. It is watered by a small
gurgling stream, along the banks of which are
built the simple cottages of the country folk.
To-day the very existence of the hamlet is unknown,
even to the dwellers in the neighbouring
towns. To-morrow the curtain of poplars has
been rent by shot and shell, the little river runs
red with blood, and the name of "Woerth" is
blazoned in letters of fire upon the page of
history. So has it been with Plevna. The little
town had never been heard of before the campaign
of 1877-1878, and it is not even mentioned
in Von Moltke's sketch of the defensive advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of Bulgaria. Now its name is known to
every schoolboy, and the mere mention of it
makes the pulse beat faster wherever pure
patriotism and unflinching devotion to duty in
the face of fearful suffering are recognized and
honoured.</p>

<p>I walked through the narrow streets of Plevna
on the day before the first battle, and saw a town
already deserted by most of the wealthy inhabitants.
Here and there I noticed a Turkish
civilian dressed in the long, loose caftan, and the
wide trousers tucked into high boots, which
formed the universal dress of the Turks; while
the Bulgarians wore the sheepskin caps and suits
of coarse yellow frieze which I had seen before
in Widdin and Sofia. The streets were paved
with cobble-stones, and the main street formed
the principal bazaar of the place; while sundry
evil-smelling lanes, running off to the right and
left, were inhabited by scowling Bulgarians, who
looked as though they would have cut my throat
with the greatest pleasure. The Tutchenitza ran
right across the main street; and here I saw the
women washing clothes and chattering together,
apparently unconscious of the dreadful trials
before them.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the long, straggling main
street, however, there was a collection of dirty
little huts occupied by the Gypsies; and when they
saw the troops coming, they seemed to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that the horrors of war were near, for they set up
a prolonged wailing, while they wrung their hands
with gestures of the deepest grief.</p>

<p>Leaving them to their lamentations, I proceeded
to investigate the resources of the town,
and was overjoyed to discover a European doctor,
upon whom I promptly called and introduced
myself. He was a very original character this
Dr. Robert, and how he came to Plevna in
the first instance I never found out. Born at
Neuchâtel in Switzerland, he disappeared from
the paths of European civilization when he had
finished his medical course, and eventually settled
down in Plevna, where he had been for ten years
before I met him. He was not a bad-looking
man, apparently about thirty-three years of age,
with a fair beard and moustache. He had a good
practice among the Bulgarians, and had evidently
become a fashionable physician who commanded
his own price. Dr. Robert lived in the best
house of the town, and drove the finest team of
four black cobs that I ever sat behind. He had
a regular menagerie in his gardens, which were
fenced with wire, and contained a collection of
storks and herons, a tame animal which I took
to be a jackal, and four deer, which we afterwards
ate. He had some good ideas as a landscape
gardener too, and had tapped the Tutchenitza for
water to irrigate his domain by means of channels.</p>

<p>After calling on Dr. Robert, I went off to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
pay my respects to the <i>kaimakan</i>, or Turkish
governor of the town, who had his quarters in the
konak, or townhall, a fine structure, built from the
stone taken from an old Roman ruin which once
occupied the site. We afterwards used this
building as a hospital. The kaimakan was very
courteous, and placed a clerk at my disposal, who
found me quarters in a small, isolated Bulgarian
house at the extreme north of the town.</p>

<p>After making these necessary arrangements I
joined Weinberger, and we both went to dinner
with Dr. Robert, who had not seen any European
except his housekeeper for ten years, and was
naturally eager to meet visitors who could tell
him of the haunts of his youth. The housekeeper
was a Viennese woman, decidedly unprepossessing
in appearance, but a most excellent cook; and
Weinberger and I, who had quite recovered
our appetites after eating the two geese at
Veltchiderma, enjoyed that dinner thoroughly.
The doctor's house was furnished with every
luxury. There were knives and forks and chairs,
not to mention a piano; and as it was the first
European meal that I had eaten for many
months, with the exception of my dinner with the
Roumanians at Kalafat, it is needless to say
that I made a first-rate repast. We drank a
great many bottles of Bulgarian wine, and the
more Dr. Robert drank the more loquacious he
became, recounting his early bacchanalian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
amatory exploits in German with a particularity
of detail that was most edifying. Then he sat
down at the piano and thumped the keys furiously,
while he roared out convivial ditties in French,
German, and Bulgarian until the whole house
shook as if under the concussion of a bombardment.
Even the Viennese housekeeper, who
made her appearance upon the festive scene with
a threatening aspect, failed to keep him quiet;
and Dr. Robert was still chanting the praises
of "Wein, Weib, und Gesang" when I made my
way to my new quarters and sank into a deep
and dreamless slumber, which even the manifold
insects of Bulgaria were powerless to disturb.</p>

<p>Next morning I rode out to my regiment,
which was camped on the hills, and asked the
colonel to supply me with a servant. He ordered
up six men for my inspection, and I chose
a particularly smart-looking young Circassian
named Mehemet, who afterwards became my
faithful adherent, and performed his duties as
groom and cook most satisfactorily. Then I
rode away to the bridge over the Vid, and
watched the arrival of Osman Pasha with the
main body. They were all pretty well fagged
out with fatigue and want of food and sleep;
but there was no time to be lost, for the Russians
were already advancing from Nicopolis upon
Plevna, so Osman Pasha and his staff rode
out at once and selected tactical points for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
disposition of the troops. A strong force was
sent out to the Janik Bair facing due north,
another detachment was sent to the village of
Grivitza in the hills facing east, and there was
also an outpost in front of the village of Opanetz.</p>

<p>After seeing the troops arrive, I went to lunch
with Dr. Robert, who had arranged to go with
me and see the fighting if there should be any.
At one o'clock I heard the boom of the Russian
cannon which marked the opening of the protracted
hostilities round Plevna, and the challenge
received an immediate response from our batteries.
Immediately all the Bulgarians in Plevna retired
to their cellars, or any other place of security
that they could find; and Dr. Robert and I
rode off along the Nicopolis road to the Janik
Bair, where the Turkish batteries were in position.
By keeping just below the crest of the hill,
Robert and I were safe from the shells, which
either fell short on the far side of the hill, or
else flew over our heads in the direction of the
town. The hills were lined with our troops,
who were all under cover, and, tying my horse
to a tree, I walked up towards the summit. On
my left I could see the villages of Bukova and
Opanetz, while on the rising ground in front of
me a mile away I caught an occasional glimpse
of the gleam of Russian bayonets.</p>

<p>Looking out from the crest of the hill on
which the Turkish batteries came into action, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
saw the ridge of a smaller hill in front of me, and
beyond it a second slope of rising ground, upon
which the Russian artillerymen had planted their
guns. These formed part of the force which
General Schilder-Schuldner had under his command,
and with which he advanced next day
with the greatest confidence to a crushing defeat.
The hill upon which the Russian guns were
planted was thickly timbered, and at first I could
see nothing but puffs of smoke followed by
leaping flashes of flame. Then came the scream
of the shell, which in the great majority of cases
either buried itself in the hill-face below our
batteries, or else flew overhead and dropped
half a mile behind us in the valley towards
Plevna. We had eighteen guns right on the
summit of the hill extended in line, with hastily
thrown up entrenchments in front, and the firing
was almost continuous. I made my way to the
extreme left, where I took up a position in rear of
the battery, and watched the firing. The artillery
horses had been left under cover in the rear, and
the men settled down steadily for an afternoon's
practice at long range. It was the first time that
I had been under fire in the open field, and I
watched the proceedings with the closest interest,
having my box of instruments and my packet
of <i>tiftig</i>, or lint, ready for treating the wounded.
Both sides were firing common shell, apparently
rather as an evidence of willingness than with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
any hope of doing serious damage at so long a
range. I counted about forty Russian guns in
action, and after a while I could see the shells in
the air quite plainly, and could pretty well judge
where they would fall. When they struck the
hill-face below us, a cloud of dust would fly up as
they exploded in the earth; and when they flew
over us, I could hear them buzzing like hornets
as they sailed away into the valley behind.
While I was making my way up to the left of our
line, I saw three Turkish artillerymen lying dead.
One had been shot in the abdomen, and presented
a terrible spectacle with his intestines all
hanging out. The two others had had their legs
carried away by shells. When I reached the
farthest battery, I found one of the gunners with
his hand ripped open by a splinter of iron, and I
rendered surgical aid to my first wounded man
under fire, washing the injury with water from
my water-bottle, sewing up the hand, and
dressing it with tiftig from my wallet. Then I
sent the man to the rear, and told him to report
himself at the hospital.</p>

<p>Here it was too that I saw my first man killed
in the open field. It happened this way. I was
lying on my stomach exactly on the summit of
the hill, and about twenty-five yards from the
end gun of the battery, watching the Russian
practice, when I saw six simultaneous puffs
of smoke and six flashes of fire dart from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
oak wood on the distant slope. One of the
gunners at the end gun in the battery next to me
was in the act of "laying" it, and was squinting
along the sights to get the elevation of the
Russian battery, when the six shells started
on their journey. Those flashes of fire were
the last things he ever saw on earth, for one
of the shells struck him full in the face and
took his head clean off. There was a spirting
from the blood-vessels in the neck, and then
the headless corpse spun round in a circle, the
legs moving convulsively like those of a chicken
when its throat is cut. I was so close to the
man that I could see every movement, and the
sight affected my nerve centres in the way that
the normal system is affected by any sudden
and horrible sight; that is to say, I turned cold
all over, and was very sick on the spot. A few
months later the frequent repetition of similar
spectacles had so dulled the sensitiveness of
my nerve centres, that I could look upon the
most shocking casualties without experiencing the
slightest physical inconvenience. We dragged
the gunner's headless corpse to the rear, where
it was buried the same evening.</p>

<p>Both sides ceased firing at about six o'clock,
at which time we had only nine men killed and
three wounded. I heard afterwards that the
Russian loss was also small. The demonstration
hardly rose to the dignity of an engagement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and doubtless the Russians regarded it more
as an appetizer for the solid fare to follow than
anything else. At Russian dinner parties there
is always a preliminary course called the <i>zacuska</i>,
consisting generally of caviare or sardines
devilled with cayenne, with which the guests
are expected to sharpen their appetites. This
artillery duel was the zacuska to prepare the
combatants for the <i>pièce de résistance</i> on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Every one knew when the fields-guns ceased
talking on the evening of the 19th that we
were in for a big fight next day, and that the
Russians were preparing to make an infantry
attack. Hassib Bey, the principal medical officer,
and Reif Bey, his second in command, were
busy making preparations for the reception
of the wounded; and the owners of several of
the largest houses were unceremoniously evicted
by the military authorities with the curt notification
that their residences were required for
hospital purposes. Weinberger and I dined
with Robert that night at his house, and had
a tremendous "shivoo," the expatriated Swiss
surpassing all his previous bacchanalian exploits,
and adding sundry incoherent battle-songs to
his <i>répertoire</i> of selections, until the Viennese
housekeeper finally asserted her authority and
closed the festivities. I went off to bed at my
own quarters about midnight, and found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
my Circassian had arranged all my effects in
order and made me fairly comfortable. All
the medical staff had received instructions to
assemble at the main hospital at seven o'clock
in the morning; so I tumbled into bed at once,
and slept until I was awakened at about six
o'clock by the roar of the field artillery in action
once more. The guns had already been firing
for a couple of hours, and the engagement was
in full progress, when I hurried to the large
Bulgarian schoolhouse, which had been converted
into the principal hospital.</p>

<p>At this stage it will be convenient to sketch
briefly the main features of the attack which
General Schilder-Schuldner delivered on Plevna
on July 20, and of the manner in which he was
defeated by Osman Pasha.</p>

<p>The total Russian force operating against him
was supposed by Osman Pasha, from information
which we obtained, to amount to thirteen thousand
men. The total available strength in Plevna was
about fifteen thousand men, most of whom, however,
were in poor trim for fighting, having just
arrived after a long and arduous march, and
having been deprived of sleep for many nights
in succession. On the night before the battle
Osman Pasha gave strict orders to the outposts
to exercise the greatest vigilance, so as to prevent
a night surprise, and instructed the commanding
officers to group their men as much as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and not allow them to straggle. An attack was
imminent; but it was difficult to foresee in what
direction it would be made. Roughly speaking,
the Turkish line of defence extended from the
village of Grivitza on the east of the town, along
the slopes of the Janik Bair, and away through
Bukova to Opanetz on the north-west, the right
wing being at Grivitza and the left at Opanetz.</p>

<p>Soon after four o'clock the battle began by the
Russian artillery opening fire upon the Grivitza
positions, and the Turkish batteries at once
replied. Then a brisk fusillade was heard on the
hills in the direction of Opanetz, and the general
advance of the Russians began. Five battalions
of Russian infantry advanced to the assault, and
threw themselves upon the Turkish left wing,
forcing it backwards.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha quickly despatched supports, and
the Turks charged home with the bayonet, whilst
the Russian troops stood firm against the attack.
The heaviest of the fighting took place on the
slope of the Janik Bair extending towards Plevna,
and here the loud "hurrahs" of the Russians
were answered by cries of "Allah," "Allah," from
the Turkish lines. After three hours' fighting
the Russians, who had sustained enormous losses,
were repulsed and driven off in full retreat, while
the reserves sent up to support them retired
without having taken part in the engagement.
The initial success of the Russians in forcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
back the Turkish line of defence no doubt conduced
towards their defeat; for, encouraged by
the result of the first attack, they straggled on
in disorder, and fell in with a hot fire from the
hedges and walls all round them.</p>

<p>While our troops were holding the enemy in
check on the left, a Russian infantry attack was
developed on our right wing, where two lines of
trenches were carried; and finally the third and
last trench was also carried at the point of the
bayonet, nearly all the Russian officers having
been killed. Turkish supports were hurried up,
and the Russians, who had suffered terrible loss,
were driven from the positions which they had
taken, and were put to complete rout.</p>

<p>When I reached the building where I was
instructed to report myself, I found that it consisted
of two large rooms, the outer of which
contained fifty beds, while the inner was furnished
with three or four benches intended to serve as
operating tables. The rooms were high and
well ventilated with many windows, and fortunately
there was an abundant water supply, while
the building stood in about two or three acres of
ground. This had originally been the playground
of the Bulgarian children who attended the school.
Now it was filled with wounded men, and the
laughter of the children was replaced by groans
of agony. Already the courtyard was full; and
as I looked up the Nicopolis road I could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a long string of Bulgarian arabas, each drawn
by two little white oxen, bringing the wounded
down from the battle-field. Only the men who
were gravely wounded were brought in these
arabas, and hundreds had to drag themselves
down on foot. As the rough, springless arabas
jolted over the cobble-stones of the Plevna street,
the sufferings of the wounded men must have been
excruciating. There was no field hospital to
render first aid, and it is not easy to imagine the
misery of an unfortunate wretch, say, with a compound
fracture of the thigh, transported in a cart
and without any surgical attendance from the
field to the base hospital. The two ends of the
bone jarring together with every movement of
the cart could not but cause the most exquisite
agony.</p>

<p>As far as the eye could reach stretched the long
line of arabas, each with its load of suffering men.
Every cart was driven by its Bulgarian owner,
and escorted by a Turkish soldier to see that the
Bulgarian did not despatch the unhappy victims
before their time. The foremost carts had already
arrived, and the entrance was blocked by the
jostling drivers all anxious to get rid of their loads,
while every minute fresh wounded kept staggering
in on foot. Even the stoical Turks could not help
moaning when they were lifted out of the carts
by unskilful hands and dragged into the hospital,
which was quickly assuming the appearance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
slaughter-house. Dead and dying were lying
one on top of another in many of the arabas,
matted together with clotted blood.</p>

<p>Other ambulances had been established in
different parts of the town; but this was the
principal one, and there were six other surgeons
besides myself attached to it. I pulled off my
coat, and went to work at once. The first man
whom I tackled had walked down from the field.
He had been shot through the jaw, and was much
blanched from loss of blood. I plugged the hole
with lint, and passed on to the next unfortunate,
who had been shot through the liver by a fragment
of shell. Part of the liver was sticking out
through the wound, and the man, who was much
collapsed, although quite conscious and in great
pain, formed a shocking spectacle. He had a
great tear in his liver. I stitched it up and
washed the wound; but the case was a hopeless
one. If I could have given him chloroform,
thoroughly opened him up, and washed everything
out, I might have been able to save him;
but there was no time for that. He lingered on
in great agony, and died on the following day.</p>

<p>In dealing with gunshot wounds, where the
variety is practically unlimited and no two cases
are the same, the surgeon has to be resourceful
and inventive. I was here brought face to face
with conditions which were quite new to me, and
with extraordinary complications, which required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the most delicate and careful operations, but which
had to be dealt with out of hand and in a few
minutes. Looking back now I am filled with
wonder that so many of our wounded recovered,
considering the unfavourable conditions under
which they were treated. The third man whom
I tackled had been struck in the abdomen by a
piece of shell, and about one foot of his intestine
was projecting through the wound. In that condition
he had been carried from the hill where
he was shot, and, needless to say, he was in a
horrible condition. I washed the intestine, enlarged
the wound, again shifted the intestine back
into its place, and stitched the wound up. In a
week or two the man recovered, and went back
to his place in the ranks.</p>

<p>All day on that terrible 20th of July I worked
in the Bulgarian schoolhouse among the wounded
men, and all day the arabas kept arriving with
fresh loads, until there was absolutely no place
left in which to lay the sufferers. In all my
surgical experience I have never known men to
exhibit such fortitude under intense agony as
these Turkish soldiers, nor have I ever met
patients who recovered from such terrible injuries
in the remarkable way that these men did. They
were magnificent material for a surgeon to work
on&mdash;men of splendid physique, unimpaired by
intemperance or any excesses. Occasionally one
found isolated cases of intemperance among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
higher officers in the Turkish army; but I never
saw a private soldier under the influence of liquor
during the whole time that I was in the country.
There were many of these men whose lives I
could have saved if I could have persuaded them
to take stimulants; but it was impossible to get
them to touch alcohol, even as medicine. The
principles of their religion forbid the use of
alcohol, and the humble Turk clings so tenaciously
to his religion that he would rather meet
death itself than violate its precepts. On account
of another remarkable religious prejudice many
of the men who came under my hands absolutely
refused to submit to amputations, believing that
the loss of a limb would prevent them from entering
paradise. Owing to this curious prejudice
many of my patients lost their lives.</p>

<p>The booming of the artillery was soon varied
by the sharp crackle of the rifles, which indicated
that the infantry fusillade was commencing in
earnest, and men began to come in who were
wounded by the heavy conical bullets from the
Berdan rifles, with which a large proportion of
the Russian forces were armed. This rifle carried
a bullet with a very high velocity; and several
cases came under my notice which illustrated
its destructive power. The Berdan rifle-bullet,
however, often drilled a clean hole right through
a man, thus simplifying the surgical treatment;
while the older Krenke rifle, with which the bulk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of the Russians were armed, inflicted a much
larger wound, and not infrequently left the bullet
embedded in the body.</p>

<p>Among the others whom I attended that
morning was a splendid young Turk who had
been shot through the head. The Berdan conical
bullet pierced the left side of the skull about an
inch and a half below the crown, and passed out
in a straight line through the other side, leaving
two holes, one at each side of the fez which the
man was wearing. It bored a hole clean through
the upper portion of the brain; but the sufferer,
though he was weak from loss of blood, was
perfectly rational. I put a syringe into the
orifice, and cleaned the lacerated portion of the
brain with a solution of carbolic, afterwards
dressing the skull with an antiseptic pad and
bandages. The man was put into the hospital,
where he remained for about six weeks, and at
the end of that time he was discharged cured.
He went back to his regiment, and I never saw
him again.</p>

<p>In one of the arabas which discharged its load
at the hospital door was a wounded sergeant.
The poor fellow had had both his eyes taken
out by a bullet, and was in great agony. We
took him in and treated him, keeping him in the
hospital till he recovered. Some weeks afterwards
we discharged him cured, but sightless,
and he went down to Sofia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Many men were shot right through the chest,
of whom nearly all died. In cases where we could
not readily locate the bullet we did not waste
time looking for it, and several men who recovered
from their wounds went back to the ranks with
an ounce of Russian lead hidden somewhere in
their bodies. Occasionally a bullet would take
a most erratic course. One man whom I attended
had been shot in the back of the neck, and the
bullet travelled along his shoulder and down
his arm just under the skin. I took it out at
the wrist.</p>

<p>A peculiar instance came under my notice of
the extraordinary vitality which a human being
sometimes displays. A couple of men brought
in a young Circassian and laid him on the floor,
all the beds in the hospital being already occupied.
He was deathly pale, and when I went to him
I found that he had a terrible wound in the
chest. At first I thought that he had been struck
by a whole shell; but I found on examining him
that a rifle-bullet had struck his cartridge case
which was strapped across his chest, and exploded
one or more of the cartridges. The explosion
had blown away a great portion of the chest,
and exposed the heart, which I could see beating.
I plugged the cavity as well as I could, and he
lived for four or five days in the hospital, perfectly
conscious all the while, and eager for news of the
fighting. I think it was on the fifth day after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
his admission that I was examining the wound,
when I found the brass butt of a cartridge embedded
in the muscles of the heart. I pulled
it out, and dressed the wound again; but the
shock was too severe, and the man died soon
afterwards.</p>

<p>We had no skilled attendants attached to the
hospital, and no one to do the dressing but a
few soldiers who had been told off for the
purpose. Blood was everywhere; and as I went
my rounds as quickly as possible among the
moaning sufferers, I had an attendant carrying
my box of instruments, a basin of water, and a
supply of bandages after me. On all sides I
heard the piteous moan, "Verbana su, effendi,"
"Verbana su, hakim bashi," meaning, "Give me
a drink of water, doctor"; and fortunately we
were able at least to assuage the intolerable thirst
which afflicts men when the moisture of the body
has been depleted by great loss of blood. All
the cases which required operations were put
aside, and left for the following day, as it was
necessary, in the hurry of endeavouring to over-take
the work, to deal with the larger number of
less serious cases first. Whenever I saw that a
case was hopeless, and that the man was sure to
die, I simply made him as comfortable as I could
on the floor, gave him a drink of water, and left
him there.</p>

<p>I remained in the hospital until three o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in the afternoon, and during the whole of that
time the carts were jolting over the stones bringing
us in fresh cases. I never stopped for a
moment whipping out bullets, sewing up wounds,
cleaning wounds, and putting up fractured limbs
in splints. Sometimes when the carts came in I
did not know which of the men were alive and
which were dead, the living and the dead were
lying so closely one on the top of the other.</p>

<p>At three o'clock Hassib Bey, the principal
medical officer, sent a message for me, ordering
me to go to another place which had been turned
into a temporary hospital. It was an isolated
building, about a quarter of a mile away from the
schoolhouse, and was on the other side of the
Tutchenitza. The building had been a private
house, and here I found about a hundred
wounded men, many of them officers, who had
been lying there helplessly since early in the
morning, with no attendance except the small
services which two jarra bashis were able to
afford.</p>

<p>A Turkish colonel shot through both jaws was
my first patient. The bullet had cut through
the base of the tongue, and the poor fellow was
unable to speak. His mouth was wide open, and
blood was issuing from it. I picked away the
broken pieces of bone, put a bandage round the
jaw to support it, and, having made the colonel
as comfortable as I could, I went on to his brother
officers. All the rest of that day I worked by
myself, with only the two jarra bashis to assist
me, among the wounded men, and when it grew
dark I went on with the minor operations by the
light of four candles stuck on bayonets. At
eleven o'clock that night I dragged myself off
to bed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a beautiful summer night, with moon
and stars shining, as I walked back to my
quarters utterly fagged out with that tremendous
day's work. A couple of miles away to the north
I could see the long ridge of the Janik Bair
shining in the moonlight. More than a thousand
Turks and more than one thousand two hundred
Russians lay stretched on the other side of the
hill, and along the line of the fighting from
Bukova on the left to Grivitza on the right.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> All
was silent now, but the hills were not deserted
yet, for the burial parties were hard at work,
and the Circassians, ever on the look out
for plunder, were gathering in the dreadful
harvest of the battle-field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>I slept soundly till six o'clock in the morning,
and then went back to the house where the
wounded officers had been brought. There were
about a hundred wounded men there altogether;
and as we had no beds to put them in, we had
to lay them on the floor pillowed on their own
great-coats. There were plenty of provisions in
the town, and I had supplies of broth, beef-tea, and
milk brought up for the patients from the central
depot. Still, in spite of everything that we could
do, it was an experience never to be forgotten.
As one moved amongst them one heard piteous
moans on every side, coming from forms which
in some cases could scarcely be recognized as
human, so terribly had the shrapnel done its
work. Those who believed that they were dying
were saying their prayers out loud, calling upon
Allah to receive them into paradise; and here
and there an officer in the delirium of fever was
fighting the battle over again, sitting up in his
blood-clotted, shot-riddled uniform, and calling
upon his men to follow him, until he fell back
breathless and exhausted. A good many of
them had died in the night while I was away,
and I told off a couple of men to bury them
at once.</p>

<p>While I was going round the house, I found
that we had two young Russian soldiers there
among our own people, and I gave them as much
attention as I could. One was a fair-haired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
young fellow, quite a lad. His case was hopeless
from the first, for he had been shot through the
lungs, and he died that day without being able to
leave any message. The other had his leg from
the knee downwards shattered by a shell, and he
lived for about a fortnight.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha had made arrangements to send
all the wounded away to Sofia, and nearly all of
those whom I attended were placed in waggons
and sent down <i>viâ</i> Orkhanieh. Many of them,
however, as might be expected, died on the way,
and the road could have easily been traced by
the dead bodies.</p>

<p>I requisitioned some beds for my hospital; and
when I had got all the wounded men dressed and
fed, I thought that my day's work was finished.
Just as I was going out for a short rest, however,
an orderly came and told me that a number of
wounded men were lying in a Turkish mosque
without any help at all, and asked me to go to
them. I found a most beautiful little mosque
nestling down in a grove of trees on a slope of
ground to the west side of the Tutchenitza,
and, mounting the half-dozen steps which formed
the approach to the main entrance, I looked
inside.</p>

<p>It was indeed a hideous sight. The square
floor of the mosque was covered with dead and
wounded men, who had been placed there on
the day before, and apparently forgotten. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
were about eighty of them altogether, and the
first thing that we had to do was to separate
the living from the dead, which was not an
easy task, as the dead were lying across the
living and the living across the dead. We took
out twenty-seven dead men first, and found that
in some cases a man with faint signs of life in
him had been lying all night, half suffocated by
his own blood and by the inert mass of a dead
comrade lying across him. The walls, which
were whitewashed, were plentifully bespattered
with blood, and soon I was a shocking spectacle
myself.</p>

<p>I put on a soldier to go round with a bucket
and pannikin to assuage the fiery thirst of the
poor wretches, and then I set to work extracting
bullets and sewing up wounds and washing
them as fast as I could, with a soldier to help
in the dressing. I undertook no big operations
simply because I had not time. It was
a race for life with many of the men; and while
there were cases there which would have required
at least an hour to deal with properly, the most
that I could spare was ten minutes.</p>

<p>By July 22 all the wounded that could
travel had been sent to Sofia, and we had
about two hundred of the graver cases left,
most of them being cases requiring serious
operations. We selected a convenient building
on the banks of the Tutchenitza, right under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the shadow of a mosque, and there we set up
operating tables under the trees in the open
air. It was strange every day to see a flock
of white doves circling round the minaret of
the mosque, and every evening at sunset to
watch the old Mussulman priest as he climbed
the tower and solemnly invited the faithful to
prayer.</p>

<p>We sent away about eight hundred of the
wounded to Sofia within a few days after the first
battle; and of those who remained behind many
died, and the remainder resolved themselves into
cases for simple operations. Amputation of the
arm or leg was necessary in many instances, and
whenever the sufferer would permit it this was
carried out. With the large medical staff attached
to the army, the work ought to have been very
easy; but as a matter of fact many of the surgeons
could not or would not undertake any important
operation, and in the few instances when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
did muster up courage to lop off an arm or a
limb the spectacle was not an edifying one.
Almost all the operations were performed either
by Osman Effendi, a Circassian, who was a really
brilliant surgeon and a capable anatomist who
had learnt his profession in Paris, or by myself.
Both of us were very young and inexperienced;
but in spite of these drawbacks it is not too much
to say that we saved many lives which would
otherwise have been lost. The foreign doctors
seemed to lose their heads in an emergency;
and it was not an uncommon thing for Osman
Effendi or myself to find some poor unfortunate
wretch, who had been smashed up by a shell or
drilled through by a Berdan bullet, absolutely
rotting away in a hospital ward simply because
the surgeon in charge would not operate. Whenever
we made a discovery of this kind, we used
to bring the patient out to the operating table
under the willow tree, and do the best we could
for him under the circumstances; but it cannot
be denied that, owing to our lack of experience,
we often made serious mistakes. I will candidly
confess that if I had possessed my present
knowledge at that time, and if I had had command
of all the best appliances, I could have
saved many lives which unfortunately flickered
out in that shady little grove on the banks of
the Tutchenitza.</p>

<p>In addition to the grave cases which involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the removal of an arm or leg, we had a large
number of minor injuries to attend to, especially
wounds in the hand, which were remarkably
frequent. When the troops were in the act of
firing, their fingers and hands were naturally exposed;
and though later on, when the firing was
mainly done from behind entrenchments, finger
wounds became far more frequent, still we had a
good many of them even after the first battle.</p>

<p>A splendid lesson in stoical fortitude was
afforded by those fellows, who tendered their
maimed hands for operation without the slightest
flinching. The stump of a willow tree which had
been cut down stood near the bank of the stream,
and here I was accustomed to take my seat, after
providing myself with a basin of water from the
stream and a sharp knife. I put a little carbolic
in the water, and with these simple preparations
I was ready for my patients, who sat cross-legged
in a row close by me. There was no administration
of chloroform by a skilled anæsthetist,
no careful dressing of the injury by a white-aproned
nurse, none of the usual accessories of
the ordinary hospital; for my operating theatre
had a carpet of greensward starred with wild
flowers, and its ceiling was the deep blue sky of
midsummer. Instead of the rows of students
who usually grace these scientific ceremonies,
scores of the snow-white doves that are considered
sacred throughout Turkey paused now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in their cooings, as they fluttered round the
minarets of the ancient mosque above the willow
grove and looked down upon the strange scene
below them. The wounded soldiers took their
turns each in his proper order; and as I sat on the
willow stump a man with a thumb or finger, as
the case might be, mangled into a shocking pulp
of festering flesh, would hold up his injured hand
to me as he sat on the grass at my feet, and
would look on without flinching while I cut away
the rotting flesh, trimmed up the place, and
washed and dressed the bleeding stump that still
remained. I did over a dozen of these cases
in one morning; and later in the campaign,
when the fighting in the redoubts began, I have
amputated as many as twenty-seven fingers in
succession.</p>

<p>One result of the frequency of these finger
wounds was that they formed a convenient pretext
for escaping service in the ranks; and though
the Turkish soldiers were too brave to think
of malingering, there was one Arab regiment in
which the offence became very common. This
was the regiment which had already shown the
white feather during the battle, and which was
only induced to hold its ground by the threat of
Osman Pasha that unless the men stood firm
he would himself open fire on them from headquarters,
and catch them between the Russian
fusillade and the fire of their own side. Compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by this unpleasant prospect, the regiment rallied,
and afterwards gave a good account of itself; but,
as might be supposed, the men were not in love
with fighting, and many of them hit on the device
of deliberately blowing off the trigger-finger so
as to be unfit for further service. We had a
good many of them to treat, and at last Osman
Pasha got to hear of it, and of course was very
savage at the malingering. He at once issued an
order that the next man found guilty of maiming
himself in this way would be instantly shot, and
the threat, as it turned out, was no idle one.</p>

<p>One morning, just as I finished my round in
the hospital, I was summoned by an orderly to
attend Tewfik Bey, and when I reached his
tent I found three men from the Arab regiment
standing there under a strong guard. Their
arms had been taken from them, and each man
had a hole through the index-finger of the right
hand. Tewfik Bey desired me to decide whether
the appearance of the injuries indicated that they
had been self-inflicted; and when I learnt from
him that if I answered in the affirmative the
men would be instantly shot, I declined to take
the responsibility, and requested that a small
medical board might be appointed to deal with
the matter. Tewfik assented, and invited me
into his tent to wait while an orderly fetched
two other surgeons. Presently Weinberger and
Kustler arrived, and we three, after inspecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the prisoners, retired to a little distance to consult.
There could be no doubt whatever about
the fact, for the mutilated finger in each case
was blackened with gunpowder, showing that the
man had placed his finger on the top of his
rifle-barrel and pulled the trigger, probably with
a piece of string. The three men watched us as
we sat at a little table under a tree and drew
up a short report confirming that the injuries
were self-inflicted. I presented the report to
Tewfik, who was smoking a cigarette nonchalantly
in front of his tent; and as soon as he
had read it, he ordered out three firing parties
of twelve men each, six of each squad having
their rifles loaded with ball, and six with blank
cartridge. A sergeant stepped up and bandaged
the eyes of the culprits, who were placed on
their knees in a row a few yards distant from
each other. A few moments were granted to
them to say their prayers, then a naked sword-blade
flashed in the sunlight, a quick word of
command rang out, a volley startled the camp,
and the victims fell dead riddled with bullets.
It was a sharp remedy, but a sure one, and after
that we had no more malingerers.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha was a strict disciplinarian, and
the splendid order which he maintained in Plevna
all through the campaign was really remarkable.
At first the Bulgarian shop-keepers wanted to
close their shops; but the commander-in-chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
compelled them to keep them open, promising
that any attempt at looting by the soldiery would
be promptly and severely punished. A military
police force was organized for the protection of
the townspeople, and the soldiery were given to
understand that any excesses would be visited
by the only penalty known to the martial code
in war-time&mdash;the penalty of death. Owing to this
decisive action, the Bulgarian population regained
confidence, and carried on their respective
businesses without let or hindrance. For several
days, indeed, after the first battle the spoils of
war stripped from the dead Russians on the field
of action by the roving and predatory Circassians
were on sale in every bazaar. One could buy
good Russian great-coats for a few piastres, while
boots, caps, and arms all had a ready sale. A
large number of crosses in bronze, silver, or gold
were taken from the dead Russians, and exposed
for sale in the bazaars. It was strange to go
shopping in the narrow, malodorous Plevna by-streets,
and watch the chaffering that was going
on over the poor small personal effects of the
brave fellows who lay out yonder on the slopes
of the Janik Bair. Many of the Russians had
gone into action with the photographs of their
wives or sweethearts in little leather cases, which
they carried in an inside pocket next to the
heart; and the Circassians, prowling round the
field on the first night after the battle, robbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the corpses of these simple treasures, and bandied
them from hand to hand with brutal jests round
the bazaars next day.</p>

<p>The simple faith which is such a dominant
feature in the Russian national character was
strikingly exemplified in some of the articles
found upon the dead bodies. I saw a Circassian
offering for sale a little painting of the Virgin
Mary and the infant Jesus, which he had taken,
according to his own statement, from the body
of a dead Russian, a mere fair-haired lad, who
had been killed by a bayonet thrust in the hand-to-hand
fighting. The painting was done on
a wooden plaque about one foot long by six
inches wide, and was evidently of great age,
probably at least two hundred years old, from its
appearance. It was found beneath the tunic of
the dead boy, and was perhaps a family treasure
given to him by his mother before he went away
to the war. There is at least no doubt that it
was worn as a charm against danger. But the
simple faith of the Russian mother could not
save her son in the grim reality of battle, and
the steel of the infidel Turk pierced the sacred
figure of the Virgin before it reached the soldier's
heart.</p>

<p>Many of the Russians wore steel plates covered
with chamois leather over the region of the
heart. These plates would stop a rifle-bullet in
those days, although the ball from a more modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Lee-Metford, Lebel, or Mauser rifle would have
pierced them like tinder.</p>

<p>No scruples were shown in appropriating the
valuables of the enemy; and the Jews in Plevna
made a handsome profit by buying Russian
roubles for a few piastres apiece from the
Circassians and Bashi-Bazouks who had gone
through the pockets of the dead, and by taking
the foreign coin away to the ordinary markets of
exchange.</p>

<p>I bought a Russian signet ring in the bazaar
one morning from a Circassian. It lies before
me on the table now, and brings back vivid
memories. It is a heavy gold ring, with a large
red stone like a cornelian, carved with the figure
of Æsculapius, easily recognizable from the traditional
accessories of the snakes and the cock. It
was surely a curious coincidence that the figure
of this legendary founder of medical science
should have fallen into the hands of one of his
own disciples!</p>

<p>Of course Osman Pasha strongly discountenanced
this looting of the dead; but it was
impossible to control the predatory instincts of the
Circassians, and in spite of the prospect of instant
death if detected they continued to prowl round
the battle-field in search of treasures. One night
five of them were taken red-handed, and hanged
at daybreak <i>pour encourager les autres</i>; but
Osman Pasha's attention was so much taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
up with the necessary work of fortification, that
the looting went on afterwards just the same.</p>

<p>To show, however, that the Muchir, far from
oppressing the Bulgarian inhabitants in the manner
imputed to him by contemporary press writers,
was always throughout the siege absolutely fair
towards them, one significant incident may be
mentioned for which I can vouch, as I was myself
a witness of it. One morning, while I was passing
by the yard of a Bulgarian butcher, I found an
altercation going on between the Bulgarian and
a free-lance from one of the Circassian irregular
bodies. Although I could not understand what
was said, I was able to gather that the Circassian
wanted some meat, which the Bulgarian would
not give him. After a minute or two of heated
argument, the Circassian drew his revolver and
shot the Bulgarian in my presence, the bullet
entering the man's foot. I reported the matter
to Osman Pasha personally, and he ordered the
instant arrest of the Circassian; but the man
was never seen again. Recognizing that death
would be the penalty of his act if he were
discovered, he escaped from Plevna that night,
and we saw no more of him. The butcher died
from his wound.</p>

<p>There was plenty of work for the men of all
ranks to do between the 20th of July and the
30th. We never knew when another attack might
be launched; and though the Russians had disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
from sight, our scouts used occasionally
to bring in word that they had seen detachments
as near as five miles off. Our men were working
away as busily as bees fortifying outposts,
digging entrenchments, and building redoubts
on the cordon of hills that formed the natural
rampart of the town. They also had to complete
the work of burying the dead, and as the Russians
had left us all their dead to inter as well as
our own this was no light task. When I had
finished my morning's work in the hospital, I
used to call on Dr. Robert and borrow one of
his smart little black cobs for a ride out to
the hills to see how our fellows were getting
on with their labours. I often watched the
burial squads at work, as I sat there on the
black cob puffing a cigarette in the glorious
summer weather, and saw them dragging the
scattered bodies together into a little heap, and
then digging a trench to hold them. Sometimes
they would put twenty or thirty into one
trench when they came on a patch where the
troops had fallen thickly, and sometimes a dead
soldier lying far away from his comrades would
be buried in a lonely grave by himself. The
Russian and Turkish dead were always kept
distinct, for the Moslem will not sleep by the
Giaour, even in the grave.</p>

<p>As I rode over the crest of the hills four or
five days after the battle, and down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
hollow where the Russian lines received the
hottest of the Turkish fire, I saw that in most
cases the Russian dead had not been buried
deep enough; now and then, indeed, scarcely
more than the three handfuls of dust prescribed
by the old poet had been thrown over the
corpse, which protested with a faint, sickly odour
at these maimed funeral rites.</p>

<p>In one little hollow I saw some locks of
curly fair hair sticking up from the ground, and,
scraping the earth away with my sword-blade,
found a dead Russian there. In many places
a foot, a finger, or a hand protruding from the
ground revealed the presence of the dead;
and as I advanced farther down into the valley
from the Turkish line of defence, I came across a
great number of bodies which had escaped the
notice of the burial parties altogether. There
they lay, with the hot July sun beating down
upon them, and the cool moisture of the earth
teeming with horrible living things beneath
them. The faces of many of the Russians, as
is often the case when death is due to gunshot
wounds, were placid and composed; while the
skin, tanned to the consistency of parchment
by the rays of the sun, showed as yet no sign
of putrefaction. With others death had come
with such instantaneous force that the expression
of the face still reflected the tumultuous passions
that chased each other through the brain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
living man in the supreme hour of battle. One
could see, to quote the vivid words of the soldier's
poet,</p>

<div class="poem">
Anger and pain and terror<br />
Stamped on the smoke-scorched skin.<br />
</div>

<p>But while the part of the body exposed to the
action of the sunlight was preserved in a mummified
condition, the lower part, which rested on
the earth, had already undergone the first stage
of decomposition. Any one who has ever turned
over a great stone embedded in a bank of mossy
earth, and seen the swarms of noxious living
creatures battening on the underneath side, will
recognize without further description the sight
that met my eyes as I prised over a dead body
here and there with my scabbard to ascertain
its condition.</p>

<p>After the battle fresh troops kept pouring into
Plevna from Sofia, and it soon became evident
that Osman Pasha did not intend to content
himself by remaining in the town purely on the
defensive.</p>

<p>Lovtcha, as we knew, had fallen into the hands
of the Russians before we reached Plevna, having
been occupied by General Sobatoff on July 16;
and Osman Pasha, having had time to look
about him, determined to recapture that town. Its
importance from the strategical point of view was
obvious, inasmuch as it commanded the main
road to Sofia, from which our reinforcements were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to come. The possession of the town was also
indispensable to Osman Pasha in order to cover
the operations of the Plevna army, and to
complete his front line of defence, which should
serve him as a base of operations whenever the
moment might prove propitious for assuming
the offensive.</p>

<p>The town of Lovtcha lies in the valley of
the river Osma, about twenty miles from Plevna,
and twelve miles from the Trojan Pass. Roughly
speaking, the river divides the town into two
parts, one of which was inhabited by the
Mussulman population, and the other by the
Bulgarians. Before the war the great majority
of the inhabitants were Mussulmans, who numbered
about twelve thousand; and Lovtcha was
then one of the richest towns in Bulgaria, boasting
no fewer than twenty mosques, three
orthodox churches, ten primary Moslem schools,
and many schools for Christians. It was placed
at the junction of several main roads, and its
position rendered it therefore important both to
the invaders and the invaded. Sobatoff had
occupied it with a column composed of the second
squadron of Cossacks of the Guard, two squadrons
of Don Cossacks, and two field-pieces with a
detachment of infantry.</p>

<p>As soon as the fight of July 20 was won,
Osman Pasha made all his preparations for
recapturing Lovtcha by a surprise. He first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
reconnoitred the position with a detachment of
cavalry, and then, taking six infantry battalions,
a battery of field artillery, and a troop of Circassian
light horse from the reinforcements which
had arrived from Sofia, he formed a column,
the command of which he entrusted to Brigadier
Rifaat Pasha, who had Tewfik Bey as his next
in command. The column marched from Plevna
at six o'clock in the evening of July 25, and
arrived at daybreak before Lovtcha. An attack
was immediately delivered on the town, which
was defended by three or four squadrons of
Cossacks and a large number of Bulgarians who
had been armed by the Russians. Only the
merest semblance of resistance, however, was
offered by the enemy, and Rifaat Pasha's column
occupied the town almost without striking a blow.</p>

<p>Thus within the space of a week the Russian
arms had sustained two serious reverses, and the
Russian commanders were evidently preparing
an attempt to rehabilitate their prestige. Avoiding
any serious engagement, and only showing
themselves at great distances, they confined
themselves to long-range artillery practice while
they concentrated their forces. Meanwhile the
Turkish army was strengthened by additional
reinforcements of regular troops and of auxiliary
cavalry. The only other event of importance
between the first and second battles of Plevna
was the recapture of the village of Trestenik,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
situated about ten miles from Plevna, on the left
bank of the Vid. This village had fallen into
the hands of the Russians; but Hassan Labri
Pasha and Mehemet Nazif Bey, with a few
battalions of infantry, a couple of field-guns, and
a troop of Circassian horse, retook the village
on July 25, and drove out the Russians, who
retreated towards their main body.</p>

<p>While these stirring events, which can be
described in a few words, but the success of
which was of vital importance to Osman Pasha's
plan of operations, were taking place outside
Plevna, I remained on duty at my hospital in
the town, hearing only at times the faint echoes
of artillery in the distance to remind me that
fighting was still going on.</p>

<p>Although hastily organized and furnished with
few of the articles which are deemed necessary
to the equipment of civil hospitals, our hospitals
were fairly efficient at the commencement of the
campaign before our resources became overtaxed.
Hassib Bey, the principal medical officer, was a
capital organizer and administrator; and although
he never interfered in the actual surgical work,
he was always ready to listen to suggestions
and to furnish us with any necessaries that we
asked for.</p>

<p>During the early part of my stay in Plevna, I
had my quarters in a small Bulgarian house
which was nearly a mile away from the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
hospital, so far, indeed, that I afterwards moved
into a more convenient spot, and my little house
was given over to the French journalist Olivier
Pain. My first landlord&mdash;who was landlord in
name only, for of course I never paid him any
rent&mdash;was a Bulgarian, and his daughter was one
of the few pretty women that I ever saw in
Bulgaria. Conversation, however, was restricted
by linguistic limitations, for I knew scarcely any
Bulgarian, and the only word of English that she
could say was "London." Wherever I saw
that girl, she would show her white teeth with a
charming smile, flash her big black eyes, and
with beautiful irrelevance ejaculate "London!"
Whether she knew what London meant I cannot
say, but her limited vocabulary expressed more
in its way than the gushing phrases of many
more brilliant conversationalists. When she said
"London" with a bright air of welcome and a
frank smile as I came home at night tired out
with the day's work, I knew that she meant,
"Good evening, doctor; I hope you haven't had
a very bad day to-day; and see, here is your pilaf
and coffee ready." When she uttered the word
with a backward turn of the head as she passed
out of the door and a pretty coquettish glance, it
was very evident that she was really saying,
"Good night now, doctor; pleasant dreams to
you, and I hope a Russian shell won't find you
in the morning." My domestic arrangements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
however, which were very primitive and did not
include much preparation of eatables, were
mainly attended to by my Circassian servant,
who proved himself to be a very handy fellow.</p>

<p>Hassib Bey instituted the excellent plan of
getting all the medical staff to meet at nine
o'clock every morning at the administrative block,
where the main hospital was placed; and after
breakfasting on coffee, pilaf, and eggs when I could
get them, I used to ride up to the rendezvous.
Hassib Bey and Reif Bey, his next in command,
used to meet us all there, and the whole lot of us
used to have a smoke together for half an hour or
so, and discuss any interesting cases that we had
to deal with. If we had any complaint to make
about the food supplied to the hospitals, or if we
wanted anything extra in the way of appliances,
our representations were listened to on the spot.
It was a capital idea, and worked very well
indeed.</p>

<p>After the first rush of work was over, I had
my own hospital to attend to. This was a two-story
Bulgarian house, the ground floor of which
was unoccupied, while upstairs there were three
large rooms, in which I had about twenty-five
patients. Beds and blankets were provided, and
I was able to make the sufferers fairly comfortable.
Two Turkish soldiers were allotted to me
to act as hospital orderlies, and they proved apt
pupils at their work. I trained them to act as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
dressers and nurses, and found that they carried
out their novel duties excellently. We had a
good many deaths at first, and news was always
conveyed to the Moslem priests, who came and
laid out the dead, wrapping the bodies in white
linen sheets, and taking them away for burial
in the Turkish burial-ground. Good, nourishing
food was provided for the convalescents, who had
plenty of beef-tea, soup, pilaf, eggs, and bread;
and possessing as they did an extraordinary
recuperative faculty and constitutions unimpaired
by intemperance, a very fair percentage recovered.</p>

<p>Although I could speak Turkish sufficiently to
make myself understood for ordinary purposes,
I found myself in difficulties when my patients
began to talk to me about their private affairs, or
to go into long accounts of their adventures on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
battle-field. Sometimes, however, I was able to
gather a few startling illustrations of the ferocity
with which the engagement had been fought.</p>

<p>One of my patients was the colonel of a
Kurdish regiment, a magnificent specimen of a
man, who had been shot in the thigh by a rifle-bullet.
The ball had entered the left thigh on the
outside, passed clean through it, and also through
the right thigh, making four distinct wounds,
which had occasioned a great deal of hæmorrhage
with inflammatory conditions and high temperature.
I refrain from giving this patient's name
as he may be still alive, and he probably would
not desire to remember the incident which he
related to me.</p>

<p>He told me that he received his wound in the
height of the action, and became for a while unconscious.
When he came to himself, he commenced
to crawl on his hands and knees towards
the Turkish lines, and on his way he came to a
Russian officer lying wounded on the ground. I
give the story now in his own words. "I saw
him lying there before me," whispered my patient
to me as I dressed his wounds, "and the impulse
to kill him came into my mind. I suppose he
read my purpose in my face, for he pointed to his
wound, and then he held up his hands to me as
if to ask for quarter. As I crawled over on my
hands and knees, I knelt over him and pointed
to my own wounds in reply. Then I drew my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
revolver and shot him through the head. My
servant, who had come to look for me, was close
behind me. He was a Kurd, and he took his
long Kurdish knife and cut off the Russian's head
before he was dead. The air made a gurgling,
bubbling sound as the knife went through the
windpipe. The Russian officer had a long fair
beard. He was a fine man, and I shall never
forget his face. You are horrified. Well, it was
war. I was not a man then, I was a wild beast.
I killed him as he lay there because he was in
my power. If I had been in the same position,
he would have killed me. It was destiny."</p>

<p>Each of the members of the medical staff had
a similar hospital to attend to, and all were
managed on much the same lines. As a rule I
finished my work in the forenoon, and had the
rest of the day more or less to myself, except
when it was my turn to attend at the main
hospital, where once a week I had to be in
attendance all night on emergency duty.</p>

<p>I was on friendly terms with the colonels of
most of the regiments, and especially with Tewfik
Bey, who used to keep me supplied with the
latest news until he went to Lovtcha, and then
I was thrown back on my own resources; but I
found plenty of entertainment in watching the
progress of the fortifications, trenches, and redoubts,
which the troops were constructing with
ceaseless activity under the direction of Tewfik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Bey, who laid out the works before he went to
Lovtcha.</p>

<p>Although not very particular as to what I ate,
I got very tired of the incessant pilaf and
scrambled eggs which my Circassian cooked for
me, and both Weinberger and I always looked
forward with lively pleasure to an invitation to dine
with Dr. Robert, who was certainly very liberal
in his hospitality. On these occasions we had
European food admirably cooked by the Viennese
housekeeper, and Robert always produced his
best Bulgarian wine. I think I can see him now,
dressed in his dirty yellow suit of Bulgarian
frieze, with his long, sinuous fingers flying over
the keys of his piano as he yelled out song after
song in half the languages of Europe until far
into the early hours of the morning. Peace to
his ashes! He used to give us capital dinners;
but I never could find out what happened to
him eventually.</p>

<p>One little incident connected with him is
perhaps worth recording here, though it occurred
at a later period in the campaign. When the
shells were falling fast in Plevna, Robert dug a
large hole in his garden, and was accustomed to
bury himself in it like a mole whenever the firing
became particularly hot. One day, when I was
watching outside his garden, I saw the housekeeper
bring in his midday meal, steaming hot
and very appetizing. Just as Robert sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
to it a shell exploded on the top of the house,
and Robert was off to his hole in the ground
like a fox with a pack of hounds at its heels. As
he lay there quaking, it seemed a pity that the
dinner should be allowed to get cold, so I vaulted
the fence and ate it myself. The cutlets were
simply delicious.</p>

<p>Of course Robert had nothing to do with the
wounded men. He was simply a Bulgarian
doctor, and was, moreover, strongly suspected
of Russophile proclivities. Long afterwards I
heard a rumour that he was shot as a spy before
Plevna fell.</p>

<p>In those days of comparative quiet which preceded
the second battle we only gleaned stray
pieces of news from the outside world. The
telegraph wire was closed to all private despatches,
and the information which filtered into the town
was consequently of the vaguest. The soldiers
who came up from Sofia certainly brought us
news as to the progress of the campaign in other
parts of the Turkish Empire; and we learnt that
while the army of the Lom was doing fairly well,
Suleiman Pasha's forces had sustained a serious
disaster at the Shipka Pass. The untrustworthy
nature of the news, however, may be understood
from the fact that for some days a persistent
rumour was current that Great Britain had
declared war against Russia, and that twenty
thousand British troops were even then at Sofia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to get a clear idea of the significance
of the second battle of Plevna it is necessary to
comprehend the position from the point of view
of the Russian commanders, who realized that
if they did not blot out their crushing defeat of
June 20 by a great victory they would be compelled
to abandon the initiative and fall back upon
a tedious defensive policy with all its attendant
disadvantages. It was clear that the most natural
course to attempt was to crush Osman Pasha's
army, for Plevna was much more accessible than
either Rasgrad or Eski-Zagra; it was easier to
concentrate a force there, and there was no immediate
danger in any other quarter. To attack
the Turkish army of the east would probably
necessitate protracted siege operations; while if
Osman Pasha were defeated, it would be easy
to reinforce General Gourko, and afterwards
advance against Suleiman Pasha's army. Thus
it was that the Russian general staff, who were
sixty miles away at Tirnova, resolved to attack
Plevna, and entrusted the task to Prince
Schahoffskoi and General Krüdener. Let us
see with what result.</p>

<p>On the 27th and 28th of July our scouts reported
the proximity of large bodies of Russians coming
from Nicopolis and Poradim, and we all recognized
that an attack was imminent. The 29th
was quiet; but on the morning of the 30th, as I
was at breakfast, I heard the boom of the heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
guns once more, and recognized that the Russian
artillery preparation for the attack had commenced,
and that the Turkish batteries were
replying. The early morning had been damp
and foggy; but when the fog lifted the sun came
out strongly, and it became blazing hot. I had
received no special instructions from Hassib Bey,
my superior officer, and I resolved to see as
much of the fighting as possible. So, when I
had finished my work at the hospital, I saddled
my horse, and galloped off as a free-lance with
my pocket-case of surgical instruments and two
large bags, one containing tiftig, or lint, and
the other bandages. For weapons I carried a
sword and a revolver, but no carbine. No field
ambulance had been organized, and it occurred
to me that I might be of some service to the
wounded. So I headed in a south-easterly direction,
where the firing seemed particularly heavy;
and about a mile from the town I rode up the
slope of a small colline, below the crest of
which a regiment of Turkish infantry were lying
under cover. The day was very hot, and the
men had had nothing to drink since they took
up their position five or six hours before. When
I got there it was about ten o'clock, and the first
thing I saw was a long procession of Turkish
women of the poorer class, who were carrying
earthen pitchers of water from a small stream
at the foot of the hill to the thirsty troops lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in position. Some were ascending with full
pitchers, and others were descending again with
the empty vessels to replenish them at the stream.
At this time the roar of the guns was terrific,
and the Russian shells were screaming over our
heads, some of them exploding in the air and
others striking the ground behind us. The
women, who were all dressed in white, with their
yashmaks over their faces, and only their eyes
showing, went steadily on with their self-appointed
task, carrying their pitchers of water up to the
men and back to the stream without a falter.
When I was about two hundred yards from the
crest where the troops were lying, a shell burst
within a few yards of me, and a fragment of it
struck one of the women in the arm. She
screamed out as the artery spirted up over the
white dress, and I made her my first patient in
the battle.</p>

<p>As soon as the other women saw that she
was wounded, they made a great fuss, chattering
away like magpies. They placed her under a
tree, and at first refused to let me attend to
her, for a Giaour must not touch a Turkish
woman under any circumstances; but when they
could not stop the bleeding themselves, they became
alarmed, and offered no objections when I
approached with my bags of lint and bandages.
I slit up the sleeve of her dress with a pair of
scissors and stanched the bleeding; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
injury was only a flesh wound, and not serious.
Osman Pasha got to hear of the women being
there somehow, and presently an aide-de-camp
came galloping up and cleared the whole lot
of them off. They went back into the town,
and I saw no more of them.</p>

<p>When I reached the crest of the hill and
looked round, I saw an immense panorama of
country thickly sprinkled with hills, and from
every individual summit a battery of field-guns
seemed to be roaring. No Russian infantry were
visible, and it was impossible to say which were
the Russian guns and which the Turkish. The
noise was terrific, and everywhere I saw clouds
of dust, with here and there a Russian battery
with six horses going at full gallop, as the
guns came into action at a new position. Over
towards Grivitza and over by Radishevo and on
the crest of every hill we had men placed, and
our batteries were answering the Russian fire.
I attended a few wounded men who had been
struck by fragments of shells, and then I rode
off due east towards the village of Grivitza, which
was the objective of both the attacking columns.</p>

<p>On the way I met Osman Pasha and his
staff, and saluted them. Osman looked careworn
and very anxious. He was riding a little bay
cob, which he always used when any specially
dangerous operations were in progress, preferring
not to run the risk of getting either of his two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
other valuable chargers killed. That little bay
cob was a capital barometer by which to gauge
the warmth of the fighting; and whenever he
made his appearance on the battle-field, it was
safe to assume that affairs were pretty critical.
Just as I passed Osman Pasha, I heard the
whistle of rifle-bullets for the first time in the
engagement.</p>

<p>Looking over towards Radishevo, I could
make out a strong Russian force in the village.
They were sending their guns on in front, and
the infantry were advancing, also following the
guns, which were going at a furious gallop. I
could see Osman Pasha and his staff riding over
towards the Bulgareni road, which lay at the
foot of the Janik Bair, with the Grivitza brook
running alongside it. As I followed them I
met several wounded men dragging themselves
slowly and painfully from the front to the hospital
at Plevna, and I was able to reduce their
sufferings a little, though of course I could not
attempt any operations even of the simplest kind.
Gradually I became aware of the general disposition
of the opposing forces, and found that
the Turks, roughly speaking, occupied the arc
of a circle south and south-east of Plevna, while
the Russian troops were advancing in converging
lines upon them with the village of Grivitza
evidently as the main object of their attack.
From the top of the hill where I stood I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
make out the advancing lines of the Russians,
while our troops by this time were below me,
standing in hastily constructed trenches which they
had dug for protection against the increasingly
heavy fire. Some idea of the infernal tumult
which was going on may be gathered from the
fact that over one hundred and fifty heavy guns
were firing incessantly, while the infantry fusillade
extended in an unbroken line from one end of
the arc of defence to the other. From where
I stood I could see the attack on the village
of Grivitza quite plainly. The Russians attacked
in column of front half a mile wide, while our
men waited grimly breast high in the trenches
in front of the village. The whole place was
so thickly covered with smoke, and the area of
the battle-field was so extended, that sometimes
I scarcely knew who were Turks and who were
Russians. I rode back a little way from the
crest of the hill to get cover, and presently my
friend Czetwertinski galloped up with eighty
troopers, who formed the bodyguard of Osman
Pasha. We had a talk together, and presently,
as we could not see much from where we were,
we agreed to go up and inspect our first line
of defence. Just below the crown of the hill
we found four thousand Turkish troops entrenched
and blazing away at the Russians who
were developing the attack on the position.
Czetwertinski and I rode together to the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
end of our line of infantry, and I could hear
the bullets whistling like hornets all round us.
Czetwertinski, as he sat there on his horse,
leisurely rolled a cigarette for himself, and then
looked round for a light. Seeing that the soldier
in the trenches nearest to us was puffing calmly
at a cigarette himself in the intervals of business,
Czetwertinski sang out to him, "Verbana a-tish,"
meaning, "Give me a light." The man clambered
out of the trench, saluted, and handed his lighted
cigarette to Prince Czetwertinski. As he stood
there in the act of saluting a rifle-bullet went
through his head, and the man threw up his
arms and fell dead. Czetwertinski remarked
to me that it was not good enough to stop
there any longer; so we retired to the other
side of the hill again, and rejoined the cavalry,
who were waiting there under cover.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture the Russians, who were
advancing in two lines of company columns, a
formation totally unfitted for modern warfare,
began to falter under the terrific fire from our
trenches. The faltering grew more decided, and
in a few moments the advance was changed
to a retreat. This was our opportunity. The
bugles sounded for the Turkish cavalry to advance;
and almost before I could realize what was
happening, I saw old Mustapha Bey, the colonel
of the regiment, and the eighty troopers, with
Czetwertinski among them, going off at full gallop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
straight towards the retreating Russian infantry,
who had already begun to run. For a moment
I hesitated what to do. Then old Mustapha Bey
waved his sword, and sang out to me to come
along with them; so I forgot that I was a simple
medical officer. I drove the spurs into my horse,
and in half a minute I was riding alongside
Czetwertinski in a wild charge against the flying
Russians. We climbed the hill at a gallop, rode
through our own men at the top, and charged
down the slope towards Schahoffskoi's fugitives.
There was a large field of ripe maize on our right
as we went down the hill, and I could see the
Russians running through it as hard as their legs
could carry them, believing of course that a
strong body of cavalry was swooping down to
cut off their retreat. Next to the field of standing
maize was a field of barley, which had been reaped
and piled in stooks. I could see the Russians
dodging in and out among the stooks as we rode
towards them, our troopers yelling and cheering
as they emptied their carbines and revolvers into
the mass of the fugitives. The Russian officers
were trying to rally their men, and parties of
them began to make a stand under some trees
and to reply to our fire. In a moment more,
when the most venturesome of the troopers had
got within forty or fifty yards of the fugitives,
the Russians suddenly faced round, and, recognizing
that they were attacked by a mere handful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of men, took up a formation and poured their
fire into us in earnest. Hassan Labri Pasha, who
was watching the whole thing, foresaw that our
retreat was likely to be cut off, and he sounded
the retreat. We wheeled our horses just in
time, drove the spurs in, and galloped back for
our lives.</p>

<p>Probably no man except one who has been in
a similar position can even faintly guess at the
rapid change of feeling which comes over one
at such a crisis. A few moments before, while
we were galloping forward against the fugitives,
I felt as brave as a lion; but when once I had
turned my back to them and heard their bullets
whistling round me, a mortal dread came over
me, and if I had had a hundred millions in the
bank I would have given it all to be a furlong
farther from the muzzles of those Russian rifles.
It was every man for himself of course, and we
did not attempt to preserve any sort of formation.
The instinct of a hunted animal flying for cover
made me turn towards the maize-field, and I
galloped into the friendly shelter of the tall stems,
bending my head low over my horse's neck and
urging him forward with voice and spur. The
maize was tall enough to conceal a horse and
man completely, so that the Russians could not
take aim at any individual mark; but they poured
incessant volleys into the field, and many a
bullet fired at random found its billet. As these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hundreds of bullets cut the maize stalks in all
directions round me, I must confess that my
previous recklessness had given place to a ghastly,
overmastering terror. Wherever I turned, danger
was by my side, and I could only press blindly
forward and hope for the best. A trooper close
by me suddenly threw up his arms, and seemed
to spring several feet up from the saddle before
he fell with a thud among the blood-soaked maize
stalks. It occurred to me then that he must have
been shot through the heart.</p>

<p>By this time the entire Russian force which
had been attacking our position on the hill was
in full pursuit; and as I came out on the other
side of the maize-field with the other survivors
of that mistaken charge, I saw with dismay that
our retreat had affected our own infantrymen
with a panic. They had held their ground stubbornly
while the Russians were developing the
original attack; but when they saw us galloping
back pell-mell with the returning Russians behind
us, the moral influence of our retreat was too
much for them, and they started to run from
the position. It was a critical moment; but the
threatened retreat was stopped as quickly as it
began; for Osman Pasha, who had been watching
the affair with his staff from the top of the hill,
took prompt steps to rally the men. The slope
of the hill, from the crest down to where the
men were entrenched, was extraordinarily steep;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
but when we rode up it, and the men in the
trenches began to follow us, Osman Pasha and
his staff came down it at full gallop, with shouts
and direful threats, emptying their revolvers at
the advancing body of their own men. This
drastic remedy had the desired effect, and the men
rallied, took their places again in the trenches,
and opened fire upon the Russians.</p>

<p>By this time it was beginning to get dusk;
and as the firing showed no signs of diminution,
I made my way back to Plevna as fast as I could
go, in the full conviction that it was all up
with us, and that the Russians would be in the
town soon after me. What actually happened
was this. The Russians took our first line of
trenches, when Osman Pasha, seeing that the
northern attack had died out, ordered down two
fresh regiments along the Nicopolis road to reinforce
the position. The men were quite fresh,
and they "doubled" the whole way, covering the
intervening two miles in about twelve minutes,
and arriving just in time to bar the farther advance
of the Russians, who fell back after some desperate
hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

<p>When I reached the town, the bullets were
falling pretty thickly in the streets, showing that
the Russians had penetrated unpleasantly close.
I saw a Bulgarian coming out of a house with
a bucket to fill it with water from a small fountain
in the middle of the street; but before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
reached the fountain he fell dead drilled by a
rifle-ball.</p>

<p>Coming to the hospital, I was soon up to my
neck in work. Gradually the firing died away,
and all night long the wounded kept coming
in, some walking and others in arabas. We
had thirty-seven medical men on the staff at this
time, and there was plenty for all to do. No
one knew exactly what had happened; and I
remember telling several of the wounded men,
who inquired how the day had gone, that we
had been beaten. Later on, however, I found
that we had won a great victory, and that the
Russians had been decisively beaten all along
the line; Krüdener's and Schahoffskoi's columns
having suffered terrible loss, while Skobeleff who
had been fighting on the Green Hills, had
retired his force in good order, and with lighter
loss. The Russian total loss was given as one
hundred and sixty-nine officers, and seven thousand
one hundred and thirty-six men, or about
one-fourth of the total force. Even this figure,
however, is believed to be largely under-estimated.
The Turkish loss was about eight hundred killed
and nine hundred wounded.</p>

<p>In spite of this splendid victory, the great
chance of the campaign was missed owing to
the want of cavalry. If we had had a strong
body of cavalry, scarcely a Russian would have
reached the Danube alive; and even as it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
panic among the Russians at Sistova was so great
that a rush was made upon the bridge, and many
waggons were actually pushed over into the river
by the crowding fugitives.</p>

<p>As for my little troop of cavalry with whom
I made that desperate charge and still more desperate
retreat, it had been absolutely decimated,
though Mustapha Bey the colonel, Czetwertinski
the captain, and the Turkish lieutenant, all escaped
as fortunately as myself.</p>

<p>In the town of Plevna we had plenty of
accommodation for the wounded, and all the
arrangements for attending to them were in far
better order than on the occasion of the first
battle. When the main hospital was full, we
sent the men off to the smaller hospitals, and
many of the less serious cases lay out in the
open air all night. It was a repetition in many
respects of our experience after the first battle;
for we had forty-eight hours of almost continuous
work, and then the great bulk of the men were
put into carts and sent away to Sofia. On the
first night after the artillery firing had ceased,
all was quiet, and the only sounds to be heard
in the town were the cries and moans of the
wounded and the loud creaking of the great
wooden-wheeled waggons as they rolled over
the cobble-stones outside.</p>

<p>As I have said, we were much better prepared
for the reception of the wounded than after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
first battle; for we had plenty of instruments,
chloroform, antiseptic solutions, and bandages,
and, moreover, we had trained a number of the
soldiers to act as an ambulance corps. These
assistants were able to help us very materially,
and had become quite expert dressers. In the
majority of cases the wounds were very severe,
as the men had fought principally in the trenches,
and when hit they were generally shot either
through the head or right through the chest.</p>

<p>On August 1 I got away from the hospital
at about five o'clock in the afternoon, and rode
out to have a look at the battle-field. Near
the spot where the Grivitza redoubt was afterwards
built the Russian dead lay thickest, and
within a space of about two acres on this rising
slope I counted fifteen hundred bodies. The
spectacle was a horrifying one. Turkish burial
parties had already been out burying our dead; but
the Russians were left where they fell. Nearly
all of them were absolutely naked, for the Bashi-Bazouks
had been there already, and had stripped
them of arms and clothing completely. I could
not help noticing the difference in physique between
the Russian soldiers and the Turks. The
Russians were far less robust, and many of them
seemed to be mere lads, hardly equal to the task
of carrying the heavy Berdan or Krenke rifle.
Broken gun carriages lay on every side, and the
ground was scarred and torn in all directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of wounded horses, lying on the
ground unable to rise, were neighing pitifully, and
farther off two or three more with broken legs
and entrails hanging out were dragging themselves
slowly and painfully to a pool of water
that had collected in a hollow at the foot of a
hill. I shot four of the unfortunate creatures
with my revolver, and put them out of their
misery.</p>

<p>Some of the wounded men were in very
strange attitudes. One man was kneeling as
if in prayer; another was on his hands and
knees; another was lying in his own brains.
All three had been stripped by the Bashi-Bazouks.
The Russian line of retreat could be easily
distinguished, for it was marked out by a track
of dead bodies laid as plainly as the track of
a paper-chase. Here and there I could see
where groups of them had tried to make a little
stand, and had been shot down thirty or forty
or fifty at a time. I saw one dead man in a
most extraordinary position. He was stuck in
the fork of a tree about fifteen feet from the
ground, having evidently climbed it for safety,
and then been shot by a stray bullet.</p>

<p>Returning from my visit to the dead, I devoted
myself again to the wounded in the hospitals,
and performed a number of amputations together
with Osman Effendi, who worked splendidly
with me. In the intervals of work next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
I rode out again to the battle-field, which was
beginning to smell terribly, so that we had to
send out more burial parties to bury them in
large trenches containing eighty or a hundred
bodies each. So terrible had been the slaughter
that some Russian regiments had literally ceased
to exist.</p>

<p>Within a very few days after the battle we had
sent away the greater number of the wounded,
and only the cases for operation remained. All
of these were removed to the main hospital, and
Osman Effendi and myself resumed our work upon
this new supply of patients. All our operations
were done out of doors in the same place under
the willow tree near the bank of the Tutchenitza.
A great number of cases ended fatally which
in a civil hospital would probably have resulted
differently; but we did not attempt any intricate
operations, and we were also hampered by the
fact that the patients frequently preferred to die
rather than undergo the amputation of a limb.
If a man had a bullet in his knee, for instance,
such a thing as excising the knee or laying it
open was never thought of, and we simply took
the leg off. This is a legitimate course for a
surgeon to adopt in time of war, because the
skilled attention necessary to the after treatment
of a delicate operation was not available, and it
was often better surgery to take a man's leg off
and preserve his life than to perform an intricate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
operation in order to save the leg with the probability
of the patient succumbing for want of
careful nursing afterwards. As in the case of
the wounded in the first battle, there were a
large number of men whose fingers we had to
amputate.</p>

<p>Trade revived quite briskly as soon as things
began to settle down again in the town, and the
bazaars were all in full swing. Many Spanish
Jews, scenting large profits from afar, put in an
appearance, and bought Russian coin and arms
from the Circassians who had secured the plunder.
A Russian rouble was to be had for twopence,
and an officer's sword could be had for a franc.
I myself bought two beautifully mounted Russian
revolvers, which I still possess.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha was overwhelmed with congratulations
upon his brilliant victory from all quarters
of Europe, and I was a witness of an impressive
scene when he was the recipient of the highest
military honour that the Sultan can bestow. It
was a few days after the battle, and I was standing
close to the headquarters camp, behind which
all the reserves were stationed, when I heard the
bugles sounding the "fall in." Everything had
been perfectly quiet, and there was no sign of
the proximity of the Russians, so that I was at
a loss to understand the meaning of the order;
but it was carried out with astonishing celerity.
Within five minutes several thousand men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
on parade under arms, and I was looking round
to see what was the matter, when I saw a Turkish
officer in gorgeous uniform galloping up to the
headquarters camp accompanied by a troop of
cavalry. It proved to be an aide-de-camp of the
Sultan, who had come up from Constantinople
with an escort bearing despatches for Osman
Pasha. Soon all the camp was in motion, and
as the bugles repeated the call troops came pouring
down to the parade-ground from the different
redoubts and the earthworks on the Janik Bair
and at Grivitza, and formed up into square.
All the field officers were present, including Adil
Pasha, the second in command. The Sultan's
aide-de-camp and some of the officers went into
the tent of Osman Pasha, who presently appeared
with the first order of the Osmanli, the
highest Turkish military decoration, pinned upon
his breast, with the cordon. The aide-de-camp
read out a special despatch from the Sultan, congratulating
Osman Pasha upon his recent brilliant
victory. He then presented him with a splendid
sword, the hilt of which was set in diamonds, and
he presented Adil Pasha with a brace of magnificently
mounted pistols as a token of the Sultan's
appreciation of his soldierly qualities. All the
officers came forward with the standard-bearers,
and Osman Pasha then delivered a stirring address
to the troops. He said that his Imperial Majesty
the Sultan had done him the honour of decorating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
him with the order which he then wore, and
had presented him with that magnificent sword
in token of his pleasure at the decisive defeat
which had been inflicted upon the Russians.
Though the Sultan had decorated him personally,
yet the credit of the victory did not belong so
much to him as to his brave officers and troops,
who, he felt certain, were still eager and ready to
try conclusions again with the enemy. He added
that the battle which they had just fought was not
to end the campaign. They were fighting for
hearths and homes, for wives and children; and
though the fighting still in store for them would
probably be even more severe than that which
they had already gone through, still he placed
the fullest confidence in their bravery and their
patriotism. The troops all cheered their leader
lustily, and the ceremony came to an end with
a great, united shout of "La ilaha illallah
Mohammed Rasul Allah."</p>

<p>During those days after the second battle the
work of fortification proceeded with ceaseless
activity under the direction of Tewfik Pasha, who
was rapidly rearing a chain of redoubts connected
by trenches and subterranean passages to bar
the passage of the Russian troops into Turkish
territory. These earthworks were marvels of
intricate construction, and at this period the
greater number of our troops lived underground
like moles, tunnelling communications between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the different redoubts, the largest of which was
the famous one at Grivitza, which contained four
thousand men.</p>

<p>When we had finished our work with the
wounded and sent them all away, I had practically
nothing to do, and used to spend my time
riding about the hills either on Dr. Robert's
trotting pony or my own charger. I got tired
of my quarters in the Bulgarian house, and
decided to flit to some place more convenient to
the hospital. I found the place I was looking
for in another Bulgarian house, situated in the
extreme north-west of the town on the bank of
the Tutchenitza, and within a couple of minutes'
walk of the hospital. It was a remarkable house,
for it had no front door and no staircase inside,
although it was a two-story edifice. There was
a large yard at the back, and in one corner of
it was the shed, which did duty for a stable.
I saw that there was a fine garden attached to
the house, and that it was separated from the
Tutchenitza by a fence. The ground floor was
inhabited by a forbidding-looking Bulgarian and
his family, and I took possession of the upper
rooms, which were reached by a flight of stone
steps from the outside. There I installed myself
in the best bedroom as comfortably as possible
under the circumstances, and Ahmet, my Circassian
servant, occupied an adjoining apartment.
He had no trouble about arranging the furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in my room, because there wasn't any, with the
exception of a wide divan running round the
wall.</p>

<p>Cordial hospitality was not at that time the
strong point of the average Bulgarian, and my
host downstairs was an unusually surly person.
I was a tenant at will&mdash;that is to say, at my
own will, not at my landlord's&mdash;but the heads of
the household took no more notice of me than
if I had been dead&mdash;probably indeed not so
much. There was one little chap, though, a
yellow-haired, blue-eyed Bulgarian boy of about
thirteen, who used occasionally to visit me; and
he endeavoured without success to explain to
me his views upon the position. I encouraged
his confidences with an eye to subsequent advantages,
and reaped the reward in milk, which
the little chap used to bring me from his father's
dairy cow. With the addition of the milk to
my daily fare, I was enabled to boil my rice in a
new way and to improve my <i>menu</i> considerably.</p>

<p>In the beautiful garden which surrounded the
house were some of the most magnificent specimens
of china asters, zinnias, and balsams that
I have ever seen. I sent some of the seed
home to Australia, and can still, even after long
years, pluck flowers which are the lineal descendants
of those that bloomed for the first
time in the blood-stained soil of Plevna. But
sometimes that garden produced another and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
ghastlier crop. About ten days after the battle
we had a terrific downfall of rain. It poured
for about twenty-four hours in torrents, and the
Tutchenitza was soon running a banker. Presently
the flood-waters encroached, and poured
across the low-lying flats, through the fence, and
over our beautiful garden. When the rain
stopped and the water receded, I walked in the
garden one morning, and found <i>débris</i> of all sorts,
which had been brought down by the stream,
still sticking in my favourite gooseberry bushes.
Among the flotsam and jetsam gathered there
was a grisly relic from the battle-field a mile or
two away. It was a human head, with most of
the flesh worn off the skull by the action of
the water, and the teeth set fast in a horrid
grin. It was impossible to say whether it was
the head of a Turk or a Russian, and I buried
it under the gooseberry bush where I found it.</p>

<p>A day or two after this great rainstorm I
rode out again over the hills and visited the
battle-field. Far down on the lower ground,
where the main Russian attack upon Grivitza
was delivered, I came upon a gully, down which
the recent rains had poured a miniature mountain
torrent. The water had scooped away the earth
that was thinly laid over the Russian dead, and
had robbed the shallow graves of the corpses,
carrying the bones away to the lowest lying
ground, and depositing them there to whiten in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the sun. Hundreds of skulls which had been
separated from the bodies were lying there. I
thought of the Kurdish colonel, and of the fate
which his Circassian servant meted out to the
wounded Russian officer, and I guessed the shocking
reason. These were the heads of wounded
men whom the Circassians had decapitated.</p>

<p>My own Circassian servant, Ahmet, was an
excellent attendant, and I seldom had any trouble
with him. Once, however, an incident occurred
through which I nearly lost him. It all arose
through a pig. Next door to my quarters, and
between them and the house occupied by Dr.
Robert, was the residence of a Bulgarian, who was
rather more affable than most of his compatriots,
and who allowed me to use a right-of-way
through his place to get to Dr. Robert's, so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to avoid the necessity of going a long way round.
I often saw this Bulgarian as I went through his
garden, and one day he told me that he was
going to kill a pig, and that if I sent Ahmet in
to him he would give him some fresh pork for
me. When I conveyed my wishes to Ahmet, I
was met by an unexpected obstacle. Ahmet
was a good Mussulman, and hated pork as the
devil hates holy water. He refused to touch the
accursed thing, and it was in vain that by turns
I bullied and entreated, threatened and cajoled
him to fetch the material for an appetizing
plateful of pork chops. He positively refused,
and at last I told him that if he would not obey
my orders I would have to send him back to his
regiment. This was an unpleasant alternative,
for with me he had light duties, comfortable
quarters, plenty to eat and drink, and no fighting,
whereas if he were sent back to his regiment he
would have to spend long hours digging in the
trenches, with the certainty of being sent under
fire on the first reappearance of the Russians.
In spite of all this he steadily refused to fetch
the pork, and I admired his steadfastness so
much that at last I went and fetched it myself.
I took it over to Dr. Robert's, and we had a
splendid dinner.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I first met that
remarkable adventurer Olivier Pain, whose
history forms one of the strangest pages in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
book of political martyrs. Tewfik Bey told me
one morning that a Frenchman had arrived in
Plevna; and as I was extremely anxious for
some news of the outside world, I determined to
call on the visitor. He was established in the
Bulgarian house which I had not long quitted,
and was receiving the scant attention which the
black-eyed daughter of the house found time to
bestow upon him, and the conversational treat
which her one remark "London" occasionally
afforded. When I visited the stranger in my old
well known quarters, I found a tall, sallow man,
apparently about twenty-five years of age, with
a small, pointed beard, and an air of intelligence
and almost of distinction. He was arranging his
few possessions in the room when I entered and
introduced myself to him. As my eyes wandered
round the room, I was thunderstruck to see this
Frenchman pinning upon the wall a photograph
of Sydney Harbour, and I asked him at once if
he knew Sydney. He replied that he did; and
when I told him that I was a native of Melbourne,
he said that he had also been in Melbourne, and
knew it well. He seemed somewhat troubled at
my recognition of the photograph, and at last,
speaking in very tolerable English, he said to me,
"Sir, I have a very high idea of the honour of
an English gentleman, and I take you to be one.
If you will promise not to betray me, I will tell
you who I am."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like yourself," I replied, "I am alone here,
and it does not matter a straw to me who you
are. You are evidently an intelligent and
educated man, and that is quite enough for me."
Then he told me that he was Olivier Pain, and
that during the stormy days of 1871 in Paris he
had embraced the cause of the Commune, and been
deported for life to New Caledonia, in company
with the fiery and <i>intransigéant</i> Henri Rochefort.
He had escaped in 1874 with Rochefort to the
Australian coast, and had reached Sydney in
safety, afterwards making his way to Melbourne,
and thence to America, where for some time
he lay <i>perdu</i>. Venturing back to Europe, however,
after many adventures he reached Geneva,
and on the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish war
was engaged as a war correspondent by one of
the principal Geneva newspapers.</p>

<p>Now war correspondents were regarded with
the utmost distrust in Turkey, while Osman
Pasha positively hated them, and strict instructions
were given that no stranger should be
allowed into Plevna without a special firman
from the Sultan. It was characteristic of the
audacity of Olivier Pain that he should have
made his way from Constantinople unprovided
with the necessary firman, and should have
"bluffed" himself into Plevna, in the belief that
among the hundreds of departing wounded men
and arriving reinforcements his presence would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
not at first be noticed. As a matter of fact,
however, he was noted at once, and eventually
had to leave the town temporarily; but for a
fortnight he continued to inhabit my old quarters,
and I saw a good deal of him.</p>

<p>Little skirmishes between our pickets and
the Russian vedettes used to occur from day
to day, and Pain began to exercise his <i>métier</i>
as war correspondent at once, writing the
most picturesque descriptive articles to his
Geneva newspaper. I was shown afterwards
a copy of that journal, in which a long account
appeared written by him, and purporting to
be a description of some heroic exploits performed
by myself. Upon the slender foundation
of my participation in one of the trifling cavalry
skirmishes which were constantly taking place,
he had built up a remarkable narrative, in which
he portrayed me, I am afraid with more vividness
than veracity, cutting down Russian troopers
by the score. However, fortunately for himself,
Pain was an enthusiastic admirer of everything
Turkish, and he found in Osman Pasha a model
of all the military virtues. It was fortunate
for him that he adopted this view in his letters,
for unknown to him they were all opened and
read by Tewfik Bey before being despatched
from Plevna. Of course Tewfik Bey apprised
his superior officer of the contents of the letters,
and the result was that Osman Pasha's antipathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to war correspondents was mollified in this particular
case. War correspondents are not usually
thin-skinned; and when at last it became necessary
absolutely to turn Pain out of Plevna
because he had no authority to be there, Osman
Pasha himself gave him a letter to the executive
in Constantinople recommending that the necessary
permission should be given to him to
return to Plevna. He was unable to return at
once as the road was blocked; but Chefket Pasha,
coming up in October with fresh troops, reopened
it, and with him came back Olivier Pain. He
survived all the horrors of the fall of Plevna, and
lived to seek for new adventures in the service
of the Mahdi in the Soudan. The quixotism of
Pain's politics was well revealed in his conduct
in going to the Soudan as a colleague of
Rochefort's, with the idea that he could assist
the Mahdi against England, and so injure the
traditional antagonist of France. In that book
of fascinating interest <i>Fire and Sword in the
Sudan</i>, Slatin Bey tells the story of Olivier
Pain's appearance in the Mahdi's camp while
his troops were marching on Khartoum, and of
his acceptance with suspicion both by the Mahdi
and the Khalifa. A few days after Pain joined
in the march he became ill with fever, and
was placed on an <i>angareb</i>, or couch, slung upon
a donkey. Growing weaker and weaker, he
slipped at last from the donkey, fractured his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
skull, and died miserably when the column was
within three days' march of Khartoum.</p>

<p>As I knew him at Plevna, Pain was capital
company. He told us what Europe was thinking
of us set there to repel the repeated assaults of
the Russians; and he gave us many stories of
wild life as a political convict in New Caledonia
and a refugee ever since in half the countries
of the world.</p>

<p>My friend Czetwertinski had come to stay
in my quarters as his health was very delicate
and he could not live under canvas; so he and
Pain and myself generally dined together, and
gathered for a smoke and a chat in the evenings.
One night a slight contretemps occurred which
came near depriving me of one of my friends,
if not both. Czetwertinski conceived the brilliant
idea of converting some of the milk which the
Bulgarian boy used to bring me into butter,
and with this object he extemporized a small
churn and turned himself into an impromptu
butter factory. The volatile Frenchman could
not resist giving his communistic feelings expression,
and he made some remark about "the
butter-making prince" which grievously incensed
the haughty Pole. An instant challenge to a
duel followed, and I had the greatest difficulty
in preventing my two friends from exchanging
shots according to the recognized code. Finally
I pacified them, and had the satisfaction of seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
them fall upon each other's necks in a cordial
embrace. When Pain finally left us in response
to a peremptory order from headquarters, he
bequeathed his stock of firewood to me as an
acknowledgment of the hospitality which he had
received; and I secured possession of this
coveted luxury in spite of the loud objections
of Pain's Bulgarian landlord, who regarded the
wood, which was now becoming a scarce commodity
in Plevna, as his lawful perquisite.</p>

<p>A curious superstition on the part of the Turks
came under my notice one night soon after Pain's
departure. I was tossing about feverishly in bed,
suffering agonies from the assaults of the domestic
insects which in Bulgaria attain to stupendous
proportions, when I heard a tremendous volley of
guns, and for the moment I believed that a night
attack was taking place. However, after a few
minutes of independent firing, the noise died
away, and I went to sleep again. Next morning
it appeared that there had been an eclipse of the
moon on the previous night, and the townspeople
were acting in accordance with an ancient superstition
when they fired off every available gun,
believing that in doing so they would scare away
the monstrous animal which was endeavouring
to devour the silver queen of night. They were
curiously alive to an empty superstition, yet curiously
insensible to hard facts, for they appeared to
tolerate the ever-present annoyance of the insects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with equanimity. When I resorted to the device
of putting the legs of my bed in vessels full of
water, so that the fleas and other hopping and
crawling visitors could not climb up to attack
me, the pertinacious creatures thought out a way
to circumvent me. They simply crawled up the
wall and along the ceiling until they were in a
position to drop down upon me, which they did.
It was the most marked display of reasoning
power in the lower creatures that ever forced
itself upon my notice. The only way that I could
baffle the voracious crowd was by moving my
bed out into the open air, and this I did.</p>

<p>In the forenoon of August 31, while I was
pottering about my hospital, I heard guns at a
distance of about five miles, and jumping on
my horse I galloped off to the headquarters camp,
only to find it deserted. Information was obtainable,
however, showing that Osman Pasha had
suddenly moved off eastward in the direction of
Poradim before daybreak with nineteen battalions
of infantry, three batteries of artillery, and all the
cavalry at his disposal. He had gone out really
for the purpose of getting information and ascertaining
the position of the Russians. It was a
huge reconnaissance ending in a battle.</p>

<p>As I had received no orders to remain in camp,
I rode off in the direction of the firing, and after
going a couple of miles I saw three or four
mounted officers. Fearing that I might be sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
back, I went a little aside, and passed them, as I
thought, unnoticed; but they speedily ordered me
to halt, and when I went up to them I found that
one was Hassib Bey, the principal medical officer.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to in such a hurry?" he
said to me; "you are the very man we want."</p>

<p>I told him that I was anxious to see the fun,
and he advised me, with a laugh, to curb my
ardour, and ordered me to remain with him.</p>

<p>We rode on together for another couple of
miles, when we came to an ambulance at work.
It was the only ambulance that I ever saw in
the field with the Turkish troops, and was a very
simple affair, managed by four surgeons, who had
brought tables, instruments, water, basins, and
bandages with them. A number of wounded
men were waiting to be treated, and a long
stream of others were coming in from the direction
of the fighting. Hassib Bey ordered me to
assist the other surgeons working at the ambulance,
and I took up my duties among the
wounded forthwith. We were stationed on the
lee side of a hill in comparative safety and out
of the line of fire; but the battle was so close to
us that we could hear the roar of the heavy guns,
the sharp rattle of the breech-loaders, and the
loud hurrahs of the troops engaged.</p>

<p>Presently a rumour reached us that our men
had captured two Russian guns on the crest of
the long ridge between Pelischat and Sgalevitcha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and a few minutes later those field-pieces, which
were made of bronze and were the first Russian
guns that we had yet seen closely, were taken
past us at a gallop by Turkish drivers heading
for Plevna. When the wounded men who were
lying all round us waiting for their turns saw the
captured guns, they were excited to the wildest
enthusiasm. Many of them rose to their feet in
spite of their wounds, and many more propped
themselves up painfully on their rifles as they
cheered the capture that had been made.</p>

<p>I remained with the ambulance for several
hours, and the record of work there shows how
much can be accomplished in the way of surgery
under active-service conditions. I had a small
chamois-leather bag in my pocket which I used
generally for carrying coffee; but I devoted it
on this occasion to holding the bullets which I
extracted from my patients. I was the only
operator; and when the afternoon's work was done,
I counted nineteen bullets in it&mdash;not a bad record
of operations all performed within three hours.</p>

<p>If a wounded man came in with the bullet in
anything like a handy place I whipped it out at
once, and in no case did we give chloroform.
Most of the men were walking back or crawling
along as well as they could, and a few were being
brought in on stretchers by their comrades.</p>

<p>Among the wounded arrivals was an infantry
captain who was a nephew of Hassib Bey. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
was shot through the calf of the leg, and he was
able to give us some details of the fighting. He
told us that the Turks had taken a Russian
redoubt, or rather a small entrenchment fortified
with sandbags, and that there were a good many
wounded men there, but no doctor.</p>

<p>I saluted Hassib Bey, and asked him if I could
go forward.</p>

<p>"All right," he replied, "you can go; but, for
goodness' sake, take care of yourself."</p>

<p>I promised to do so, and galloped off towards
the sound of the fighting. On my way I passed
a long string of wounded men making their way
back to the ambulance, and was able to stanch
their bleeding in many cases, and place them in
a better condition for continuing their journey.
Presently I came across several dead men, and
the shells began to fly about. As I advanced
farther the numbers of the dead increased, and
the bodies of several Russians among the Turks
marked the spot where the fighting had been
hand-to-hand. Soon I saw the Russian camp
about a mile away. It consisted of a number of
little wooden huts on a slight slope in front of the
village of Pelischat, and there were a good many
tents as well. I could see the Turkish troops
engaged; but as I came up to them, they were
beginning for the second time to fall back under a
hot fire from the Russians.</p>

<p>The country was very open, and lightly timbered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with here and there a few beeches and walnut
trees, under which little groups of wounded men
were resting on their way to the rear. It was
plain that the Russians had recently occupied
the ground which our troops at this moment
were holding, for lying on the plain were many
wounded Russians who had been left behind
when their regiments fell back, and those hapless
creatures received short shrift from the irregular
troops fighting under the Turkish flag.</p>

<p>One instance of the savagery with which the
conflict was conducted I witnessed personally;
and though it shows the Turkish irregulars in
very lurid colours, I can vouch for the performance
of similar and even worse atrocities on the
part of the Cossacks a few days later.</p>

<p>As I was looking at the firing and wondering
how much longer our men would be able to hold
the advantage which they had gained, I saw a
Circassian, with a most diabolical expression on
his face, stooping down to pluck some of the
long grass that grew there abundantly and wiping
his <i>camer</i>, or short sharp sword, upon it. I
rode up to see what he was doing, and found
that he had just cut the head off an unfortunate
wounded Russian. The headless trunk, still
quivering with muscular contractions, lay on the
ground at his feet, and he was holding up his
horrid trophy by the hair.</p>

<p>I rode on to the small earthwork which our men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
had captured. The regiment which had taken
it still held possession, and the Russian troops
were advancing in strong force to recapture
it. I gathered that desperate fighting had
gone on here, and that the redoubt had already
been captured and recaptured two or three
times. The men who were then holding it
were the remnant of the attacking party, and
when I was about a hundred yards from the
fortified spot I passed an immense number
of Turkish dead. They were the first company
in the column of assault which perished to a
man. The Russians in the redoubt must have
reserved their fire, for nearly every man of the
first company had five or six bullets through
him. The redoubt itself was full of dead and
dying men, and the Russians, having rallied,
were already coming back beyond their foremost
line, being within about five hundred yards of the
redoubt. It was plain that if our men did not
retire they would be annihilated, and they began
to fall back in good order, taking as many of the
wounded with them as possible.</p>

<p>One of the first men I saw was Czetwertinski,
who was captain in a cavalry troop. He told
me that a few minutes before I arrived his
horse had been killed under him by a shell
which ripped the animal's side open. So perished
the magnificent black charger which no man in
the squadron could ride but Czetwertinski; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
horse to whom he really owed his commission.
Czetwertinski had been left unmounted for a
minute or two; but he speedily took the horse
ridden by his servant Faizi, who had to find
his way back as best he could.</p>

<p>The shells began to come pretty thickly
among us, and the Russian gunners were making
very fair practice. I saw a Turkish regiment
lying down close by some trees, when a couple
of shells exploded almost simultaneously among
them, killing seven men and wounding many
more, whom I attended on the spot.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha with Tewfik Bey and his staff
were there in the thick of it. The commander-in-chief
had had three horses shot under him
that day. Presently our men began to retire
in earnest, under a perfect storm of shot and
shell from the returning Russians. All our
wounded men had been got away except two
who were left behind in the redoubt. I saw
them there, and, realizing what their fate would
be when the Russians should have retaken the
redoubt, I decided to make an effort to save
them. I got into the redoubt, and found that
one of the men had been shot through the neck
by a rifle-bullet. He was bleeding terribly, and
was already blanched to the colour of death.
The other man had been struck in the left thigh
by a fragment of shell which had shattered the
bone. I got them both out, and managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
get the man who was shot in the neck upon
my horse. I placed him in the saddle, and I
put the man with the shattered leg up behind
him. I held the second man in position with
my right hand, and led the horse by the bridle
with the left. The man with the broken leg
was suffering terrible agony, but he held up his
comrade in front of him and prevented him
from falling off. In this way we started to rejoin
our troops, who were now nearly half a mile
away, retreating slowly and firing as they went.
The Russians were within about four hundred
yards of the redoubt when I left it with the
two wounded men and the horse.</p>

<p>The Russians were pouring in a hot fire on
our retreating troops, and our men were answering
at intervals, so that I was caught between two
fires. I could hear the Russian shells screaming
over my head as I made my way back. Our
pace was necessarily slow, for I had to walk the
horse all the way, and to take the utmost care
lest the men should fall off. When we had got
about half a mile from the redoubt, the man in
front fell off the horse dead, and I left him there.
I put the other man into the saddle; and after
a period that seemed like a lifetime, I reached
our foremost lines and went on through them,
and out of the line of fire, without having
received a scratch.</p>

<p>We saw several regiments of Russian cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
detach themselves from the main body and come
galloping down as if to cut off our retreat; so our
officers ordered the field-guns into action, and we
opened a destructive shell fire on them which
stopped their pursuit. The main body of the
Russians also drew back, and did not pursue us
farther; so that without further misadventure
we reached the site of the field ambulance, and
I placed my man in one of the waggons after
bandaging up his leg. When I took him off the
saddle, I noticed a little pyramid of clotted blood,
about three or four inches high, on the horse's
wither. It had been caused by the slow drip-drip
from the neck of the first man before he
fell off dead.</p>

<p>I stopped at the field-ambulance depot attending
to the wounded men until about six o'clock
in the evening, when we all cleared off and went
back to Plevna. This was the battle of Pelischat,
otherwise named Sgalevitcha. We had
about one thousand three hundred men killed
and wounded, and we had gained absolutely
nothing. I never could understand the exact
object of this sortie from Plevna, since even
if we had succeeded in capturing the Pelischat-Sgalevitcha
position we could never have
held it.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of September 4 an
orderly came to my quarters before I was up, and
said to me, "At eleven o'clock you will see some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
troops advancing by the Lovtcha road, and you
will follow them."</p>

<p>I asked him where they were going, and he said
that he did not know. I inquired how long we
were likely to be away, and he said that he had
no idea, adding that I had better take my instruments
with me because I should probably want
them.</p>

<p>After I had done my work at the hospital, I
went up to the headquarters camp, and found
that Osman Pasha and a number of officers,
Hassan Labri Pasha, Emin Bey, Tahir Pasha,
Tewfik Bey, Osman Bey, and Yalaat Bey, with
sixteen battalions and three batteries, were marching
out along the Lovtcha road, and I joined
them at once. About a mile from Plevna on
this road were some large vineyards laden with
clusters of ripe grapes, which had attracted the
attention of our troops some days before this. In
fact, the Turkish soldiers, in their desire to get
the ripe fruit, had been in the habit of stealing
out by night past our vedettes into the vineyards,
and several of them had been shot by the
Russian outposts; strict orders had accordingly
been given to the troops to refrain from indulging
their appetite for grapes under the circumstances,
and the Turkish sentries had been instructed to
shoot any men who attempted to pass them
during the night for the purpose of getting into
the vineyards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>When, however, we were marching out towards
Lovtcha in the daytime, it was impossible to keep
the troops out of the vineyards; and many of the
men who had not been too plentifully supplied
with rations for some time past gorged themselves
with fruit to such an extent that they
became ill with dysentery, and I had to attend to
them. On the outskirts of Plevna also I noticed
many Turkish professional beggars who pestered
the troops for money; and as it was considered
lucky to give something in charity before going
into action, the soldiers were very liberal, and
the beggars reaped a rich harvest of piastres.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as we were well clear of Plevna
and out into the open country, we fell in with
some Russian cavalry vedettes, and began a
period of intermittent fighting which continued
all that day. When the vedettes saw that we
were in strong force, they fell back upon a field
where the corn had been cut and stood piled up
at intervals in stooks. It was quite interesting
to watch them dodging for cover from one stook
to another, while our men tried to pick them off
with their rifles. A good many of the Cossacks
fell in the wheat-field, and the remainder were
driven back without difficulty. Hardly had we
got rid of those, however, when three or four
Russian infantry regiments put in an appearance
with a couple of batteries of artillery, and opened
fire on us. We were drawn up in very open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
order, and Osman Pasha sent a couple of
batteries up to the crest of some rising ground,
and we started to shell the enemy, still continuing
to push forward with the main body.
There was a small creek to cross, and we had a
hard task to get the guns over the bridge under
a heavy fire from the Russians. It was very
exciting work; and as Tewfik Bey was directing
the passage of the bridge, his horse was killed
under him by a shell. At last, however, we got
safely over, just as it was growing dusk, and
sending out skirmishers in front we continued
to advance. The firing went on for some hours,
sudden sheets of flame appearing on both sides
in the twilight as the opposing troops discharged
volley after volley; but our casualties
were very few, and at last there was a cessation
of hostilities.</p>

<p>We camped in a wheat-field which had just
been reaped, and Weinberger and I sat all night
in one of the stooks, holding our horses. We had
no rations with us; but I had had a good feed
of grapes in the morning, and with some cobs
of maize that I had put in my pocket before
starting we managed to satisfy our hunger. As
we squatted in the stook together, Weinberger
and I discussed the situation seriously, and came
to the conclusion that it was by no means
reassuring. In point of fact we made up our
minds that our last hour was all but come, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
we made sure that before morning the Russians
would bring up their troops and we should have
to be struck by a flank attack. Our communication
with Plevna would no doubt be cut off
during the night, and we apprehended that when
the morning came our force would probably be
annihilated. When day broke, however, we
looked out of our stook, and found to our intense
relief that there was not a Russian in sight
anywhere. It was the most beautiful morning
that I remember to have ever seen; and after
the bare hills round Plevna and the narrow
streets of the town, the well timbered, undulating
country was a delightful sight.</p>

<p>The march was resumed soon after daybreak,
and it must have been midday before we halted
in the doghole Bulgarian village of Kakrinka, a
little distance eastward of Lovtcha. A number
of pigs belonging to the fugitive villagers were
roaming about among the empty cottages, and
the Circassians, who, like all good Mussulmen,
regard the pig as a filthy and abominable
creature, showed their religious zeal by shooting
several of them. On the outskirts of the village
we met a Bulgarian woman with two children,
and from her we learnt the fatal news that
Lovtcha had fallen two days before. Our march
from Plevna had been with the object of relieving
Rifaat Pasha, who commanded the garrison at
Lovtcha; but we had arrived too late, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
had been attacked by an overwhelming Russian
force, and the Turkish troops in Lovtcha had
been cut to pieces.</p>

<p>What had happened was this. Skobeleff had
advanced upon Lovtcha on September 1, with
about twenty-one thousand men and eighty-four
guns, exclusive of the Cossacks and their batteries.
Aware that he was vastly outnumbered, Rifaat
Pasha had sent an urgent request to Osman
Pasha in Plevna for immediate assistance; but
the commander-in-chief apparently considered that
the Lovtcha position could hold out for a few
days, and delayed to send reinforcements at once.</p>

<p>During the night of September 1, Skobeleff had
thrown up entrenchments and established batteries
on a hill two miles from Lovtcha, and opened
fire early on the morning of the 2nd upon the
position. Later in the day the main Russian
body had come up, and thrown up entrenchments
to prepare for the general attack, which took
place on September 3. After three hours of
desperate fighting, the position was carried, and
the Turks withdrew their left wing across the
river Osma. The attack on the second Turkish
position was then commenced, and the citadel of
Lovtcha was at last carried by Skobeleff and his
Russians, after a general rush from all sides late
in the evening.</p>

<p>Most of the Turkish fugitives had already
fled towards Mikren, twelve miles south-west of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Lovtcha, hotly pursued by Cossacks and artillery.
Cut down by the Cossacks or killed by Russian
shells, the Turkish force was practically wiped
out. Ignorant of the details, however, and knowing
only the bare fact that Lovtcha was in the
hands of the Russians, we pressed on towards
the position; and when we were about five miles
from Lovtcha, we saw a couple of regiments of
cavalry and a regiment of infantry drawn up on
the bank of the Osma. They advanced over the
plain to meet us; and as we were well posted
on a fairly high eminence, we opened fire on
them with artillery. I saw one of the shells
drop right in the middle of a squadron of cavalry,
and five or six men with their horses were all
down on the ground together.</p>

<p>Under the stress of the artillery fire the cavalry
scattered and retired, some remaining to pick
up their wounded. We continued to fire upon
these, and killed about twenty-five or thirty more
of them. Below the eminence upon which our
troops were drawn up was a wood of dwarf oaks,
walnuts, and beeches running down into the
plain which form the valley of the Osma; and
Osman Pasha, believing that a Russian force was
concealed in the wood, sent down a couple of
battalions to clear it.</p>

<p>I sat on my horse on the top of the hill,
and watched this interesting operation. There
were little open spaces here and there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the wood, and I could see the red fezzes of
the soldiers bobbing about among the trees as
they worked the cover exactly like a pack of
foxhounds. There was a great deal of shouting
and indiscriminate firing, and we all expected to
see the Russians bolting out of the wood on
the other side. It was intensely exciting; but
at last we saw the fezzes emerging on the far
side of the wood, and we realized that they had
drawn it blank. There was not a Russian in
the place; but I had three wounded Turks to
attend to who had been shot by their own
comrades when the promiscuous firing was
going on in the wood.</p>

<p>As we looked over upon Lovtcha from the hill
where we were halted, the town appeared as if
it was on the stage of a vast theatre, while we
were in the dress circle. Below us was a long
green plain with the silver thread of the river
Osma meandering through it, and farther away
was the town of Lovtcha nestling in the ranges.
On the banks of the river were two Bulgarian
villages, and we could see Russian troops in
both of them.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha held a council of war on the
top of the hill, and all the principal officers
attended, the question debated being whether an
attempt should be made to recapture Lovtcha
or not. The general opinion was that it was
inadvisable to make the attempt, and Hassan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Labri Pasha alone was in favour of an attack. At
last, after discussing all the arguments for and
against, it was decided not to attack such a strong
position occupied by an immensely superior force;
and Osman Pasha, much against his will, was
obliged to order a return to Plevna.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our cavalry and Circassians were
sent down the hill to make a reconnaissance, and
I went with them. After going some little
distance, we came across a ghastly evidence of
the ferocity of the fighting, for we counted nearly
four hundred Turks all lying dead together.
They had apparently tried to break away when
Lovtcha fell, and had been cut down by the
Cossacks when making a last stand under the
walnut trees. Every corpse was fearfully disfigured.
The faces had been slashed with sabres
even after death, and the corpses had been
subjected to the horrible indignities which are
usually supposed to be practised only by the hill
tribes of Afghanistan. Whether those atrocities
were committed by the Russians or by the
Bulgarians I could not definitely determine;
but the sight enraged the Circassians to an
appalling extent, and their threats boded ill for
any Russians who might fall into their hands
alive.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the column to return
to Plevna by the same way that it had come,
because we knew that the Russians had seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
some important positions on the road, fortified
them with earthworks, and brought up their
artillery. Consequently Osman Pasha decided to
make a <i>détour</i>; and as Lovtcha was about due
south of Plevna, we headed at first in a westerly
direction and gradually worked round to the
north.</p>

<p>It was an intensely hot day, and we all suffered
severely from thirst, having been without water
for several hours. I managed to find a pool of
dirty water, however, and I drank as much as
I could, not knowing when the next opportunity
for a drink might arrive. As for food, all that
we had consisted of the cobs of maize that we
gathered in the fields as we passed.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, however, we had another
meal with a different <i>menu</i>. As I passed through
a Bulgarian village with an advance party of
Circassians, we came to a farmhouse on the top
of a ridge well timbered with walnut trees. The
Circassians made a hurried investigation of the
premises, and then set fire to some outbuildings
which were thatched with straw. They had
found a hive of bees in the shed, and calmly
burnt the place down to smoke them out, so
that we secured an excellent meal of walnuts
and honey.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha was very strict in putting down
pillaging, and an instance occurred on the same
afternoon of the severity with which he punished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
any infraction of orders in that respect. As the
column passed through one of the small Bulgarian
villages which were sprinkled at frequent intervals
along the line of route, a small field of tobacco
enclosed by a brushwood fence was espied, and a
Turkish sergeant who was pining for a cigarette
could not resist the temptation, but climbed
through the fence and filled his pockets with
the dry leaf. Osman Pasha happened to see the
incident; and, putting his horse at the fence, he
jumped over into the tobacco-field, seized the
sergeant and tore the stripes from his shoulder,
degrading him to the ranks for his insubordination.</p>

<p>After we had marched about five miles beyond
the farmhouse where we had got the honey, we
camped for the night, and a very unpleasant night
it was. The bivouac was pitched in the middle
of a wide expanse of swampy ground, which was
so moist that the water oozed through as one sat
on the grass. I procured a plank, and lay on it
all night, snatching a few minutes of fitful slumber
at intervals.</p>

<p>At about eleven o'clock I was roused by a
terrific rattle of infantry fire, and we all leaped
to our feet firmly convinced that the long expected
Russian attack had come at last. All was confusion
as the men hastily threw themselves into
formation and rammed the cartridges into their
rifles; but the firing stopped as unexpectedly as
it had begun, and we were left staring into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
darkness in anxious suspense. Soon we discovered
that it was a false alarm. A white horse
which had been wounded in the fighting round
Lovtcha had dragged himself painfully all the
way from that vicinage after our column, recognizing
the bugle calls of the army to which he
belonged. But the poor brute paid the penalty
of devotion, for our sentries mistook him in the
darkness for a Russian vedette, and an alarm was
sounded which brought about a volley of musketry
fire that put him out of his pain at once.</p>

<p>Next morning the column started very early,
and marched through beautifully timbered, undulating
country. We saw a couple of Russian
vedettes galloping away from one of the Bulgarian
villages, and guessed that the enemy were in the
neighbourhood. But they kept out of our way,
and did not provoke an engagement.</p>

<p>At about two o'clock in the afternoon, as I was
riding with the Circassians in front of a battery
of field artillery, I heard a terrific explosion, and,
looking round, saw a column of smoke behind
me fully a hundred feet in height. There
were a number of small black fragments falling
through the smoke, and I found that an explosion
had taken place in one of the gun carriages. The
ammunition had gone off in some mysterious way,
and the black fragments falling through the air
were all that was left of the two unfortunate
gunners who had been sitting on the ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
box. Both the wheel horses were killed on the
spot, and one of the drivers was badly injured.
No one ever knew how that mysterious explosion
occurred. That night we camped in the open
again, and at eleven o'clock next morning we
arrived at Plevna. I went to my quarters, had
a wash, and then resumed my work at the hospital.
But there was not much to do, and at two o'clock
I was free to take a walk through the town.</p>

<p>To my intense surprise I saw a man who
looked like an Englishman; and as I had not
seen an Englishman for several months, I shouted
to him, half in Turkish and half in English, to
ask him who he was. He proved to be a man
called Drew Gay, the correspondent of the
London <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and he wore an extraordinary
nondescript get-up, including a little
forage cap, patent leather riding-boots, and an
enormous cavalry sword. He was on his way
to pay a visit to the kaimakan, and was accompanied
by a German artist named Lauri.</p>

<p>This little Lauri was a charming fellow, and
full of the spirit of adventure. He was a great
friend of Hamdi Bey, who was the son of
Edim Pasha, the grand vizier, and in this way
he was able to exercise sufficient influence to
secure a firman authorizing him to visit Plevna.
Lauri had lived in Cairo for some time, and
had earned some notoriety by painting a portrait
of the Khedive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day occurred the third and greatest
battle of Plevna&mdash;a battle in which the enormous
value of the breech-loader when backed by entrenchments
was fully demonstrated, as were also
the magnificent pluck and endurance of the
Turkish troops.</p>

<p>Those two factors in the Turkish defence, <i>viz.</i>
rapid rifle fire and complete field fortification,
were justly regarded by the Russian general,
Todleben, the principal defender of Sevastopol, to
have been the chief causes of the overwhelming
defeat of the Russians in the third battle of
Plevna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>During the six weeks which had elapsed since
we entered Plevna from Widdin, I had plenty
of opportunities of watching the natural genius
of the Turks for fortification unfold itself. The
pick and the spade were never idle night or day
since our tired troops first camped on the Janik
Bair; and now on the eve of the great battle
the splendid result of their labours was apparent.</p>

<p>Plevna was defended by a line of earthworks
of tremendous strength, drawing a ring of fire
almost completely round the town. The chain
of redoubts extended in the form of a horseshoe,
the toe of which, pointing due east, was formed
by the Grivitza redoubt, while one heel was at
Opanetz in the north, and the other at Krishin
in the south. Plevna itself lay, as it were, in
the "frog" of the foot, the nearest earthworks
on either side being the Bukova redoubts on the
north, and a double redoubt facing the "Green
Hills" and dominating a long stretch of sloping
vineyard on the south. It was round the
Grivitza redoubt in the toe of the horseshoe,
and this double redoubt close into Plevna in
the heel, that the fiercest fighting of the whole
protracted series of engagements was centred.</p>

<p>In six weeks the Turkish troops, under the
direction of Tewfik Bey, had constructed the
most elaborate and perfect system of field
fortification that the world had ever seen&mdash;a
system which utterly routed the old military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
idea that a bold and well reinforced attack must
always succeed against a defended position.
It may be as well to briefly describe the main
features in the construction of these works as
they appeared to an untechnical observer.</p>

<p>The usual type of redoubt was a large quadrangular
fort, the walls of which were about
seven feet high on the outside, and about
twenty feet in thickness, the earth of which
the walls were formed being a stiff loam, admirably
suited for the work. Field-pieces were
mounted inside the fort and fired through
embrasures protected by bonnettes. The
troops fired over the top of the parapet from
a banquette reached by steps from the floor which
was excavated below the level of the ground
outside. The Grivitza redoubt, which was one
of the largest, was a perfect square, each side of
which was about fifty yards in length. Inside,
the redoubt was divided into four compartments
by a huge traverse of earth about eight feet thick,
which was designed to protect the defenders
from reverse fire. Communication between the
four compartments was afforded by narrow
passages left open between the cross-walls and
the exterior wall. The ammunition magazine
was stored in a great subterranean chamber
excavated underneath the massive cross-walls;
and so efficacious was this mode of storing the
cartridges, that during the four days' bombardment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
only two explosions occurred, although it
is computed that the Russians fired at least three
hundred thousand shells into the redoubts. In
the Ibrahim Bey redoubt a segment of a shell
found its way into the magazine, which blew
up during the height of the attack, killing forty
of the defenders, Colonel Ibrahim Bey himself
falling at the head of his men soon afterwards.
In the Yunuz Bey redoubt in the extreme south-west
there was also a disastrous explosion.
Yunuz Bey, who commanded all the Krishin
redoubts, survived the assault of Skobeleff and
was decorated for personal bravery, together
with Tewfik Bey, after the battle.</p>

<p>Access to each redoubt was gained from the
rear, and in some cases one side was also left
open, as Skobeleff's troops found to their cost in
the work of which they held temporary possession.
Sleeping accommodation for the artillerymen
was provided inside the redoubts, while the
infantrymen were lodged outside in the trenches.
There was something weirdly dramatic in the
sight of those Turkish gunners, black and weary
and smoke-begrimed with battle, sleeping, as I
have often seen them, in their narrow resting-places
scooped out of the stiff loam in the inner
side of the great wall of the redoubt. The
Russian shells came crashing into the exterior
face of the earth wall; but the gunners slept on
calmly in their subterranean clay beds, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a brief slumber mounted to relieve their comrades
again, often indeed only to exchange their narrow
beds in the thickness of the earth wall for couches
in the cold, wet earth outside and the sleep
that knew no waking. Immediately in front of
the redoubt in every case was a ditch about
fifteen feet wide and ten feet deep as a first
line of defence. Farther in advance was a line
of trenches, in many cases connecting with an
adjacent redoubt; and a second line farther on
down the slope of the hill provided another line
of fire. The trenches had breastworks about
three feet high, pierced with loopholes for rifles
at intervals of one foot six inches. Covered
passages effectually connected the trenches, and a
network of similar passages afforded ample living
accommodation for the troops. The scale upon
which all these works were carried out may be
imagined when it is mentioned that one of the
redoubts contained in interior area more than ten
thousand seven hundred square yards, and was
provided with subterranean chambers affording
lodgment for troops and staff as well as ample
storage room and stabling for horses.</p>

<p>Of course the redoubts were not all uniform
in exact pattern, some of them being designed
for artillery and infantry, while others were defended
by infantry only. In many of the works
a second line of rifle fire was obtained from a
covered way leading outside, so that when all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the resources of a redoubt and trenches were at
work an unremitting fire of three and in some
cases four successive tiers was obtained. The
supply of ammunition was practically unlimited;
and it is not difficult to recognize that, under such
conditions, an assaulting force could not but be
terribly scourged both by infantry and artillery.</p>

<p>During the night of September 6 the Russians
brought up their artillery under cover of the
darkness, and threw up cover for the guns with
their entrenching tools. When the morning
of September 7 broke in cold and drizzling
rain, the Russians had surrounded us, the Roumanian
divisions being placed in the north and
north-east, while the Russian divisions lay in the
south-east and south. All the west side was
occupied by cavalry, who commanded the valley
of the Vid and the Orkhanieh road, so as to
cut off the Turkish fugitives who were expected
to fly in that direction.</p>

<p>The Russians had about eighty thousand infantry,
twelve thousand cavalry, and four hundred
and forty guns; while the Turkish forces
numbered about thirty thousand infantry with
seventy-two guns and an inappreciable number
of cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Every precaution had been taken by the
Russians to avoid a repetition of the previous
disasters which had attended their attempts to
force Plevna by assault, and they relied for
success upon their vast preponderance in numbers
and upon a prolonged artillery preparation which
was intended to demoralize the defence.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the morning of September 7
I heard the roar of the commencing bombardment
from Opanetz in the north, and it
quickly worked round, until the two Grivitza
redoubts due east of Plevna were involved.
Across the Bulgarian road, Ibrahim Bey's redoubt
and three or four others connected with it sustained
a fierce bombardment, and the line of
guns extending southwards across the Tutchenitza
ravine and the Lovtcha road added their voices
to the general roar as far as the village of
Brestovitz, where a heavy fire from siege-guns
was concentrated on the Krishin redoubt. A
short experience of the bombardment, however,
showed our troops that they had little to fear
from the Russian artillery, and casualties were
few and far between in the redoubts.</p>

<p>What was called the "mammoth battery,"
consisting of a tremendous group of fifty heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>Russian siege-guns, was placed in position due
east of Plevna, and bombarded Ibrahim Bey's
redoubt all day, the guns of the redoubt replying
with spirit. The garrison of the redoubt were
so well covered that they lost only forty men in
killed and wounded after the whole day's firing,
and the damage which was done to the earthworks
during the day was repaired at night.</p>

<p>Soon after the commencement of the action I
rode over towards Ibrahim Bey's redoubt, taking
Lauri, the newly arrived German artist, with me.
As we rode along together a Russian shell struck
the ground about a hundred yards in front of us,
and, ricochetting, flew over our heads and lodged
in the ground behind us. Lauri was tremendously
excited. He rushed off and picked up
the shell, which he held in his arms as if it
was a baby, exclaiming at the same time in his
broken English, "I am forty-three years of age,
and this is the first time that I haf seen a gun
fired. Ah, what would my wife say if she
could now see me!" With some difficulty I
induced him to moderate his transports and drop
the shell, which I was afraid every moment would
explode and dissipate poor Lauri into space.
By keeping on the lee side of the hill and
dodging up at intervals we could catch glimpses
of the "mammoth battery" scarcely a mile away,
and could see the spirts of flame enveloped in
white smoke as the guns were fired in a tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
volley. Sometimes the shells struck the
redoubt, and clouds of earth flew up; while at
other times the projectiles went screaming over
the crest of the hill, and fell in the low ground
near the town.</p>

<p>I occupied myself in my hospital for the next
few days, riding out at intervals to watch the
progress of the bombardment, which was being
prosecuted with terrific force. On the 10th the
village of Radishevo, where the Russian batteries
were in position, caught fire, and the conflagration
lit up the wet grey sky in the east. Little
damage was done to our redoubts, and the artillery
preparation was so far a failure.</p>

<p>On the 11th the general assault took place.
I was working away in the hospital all the
morning, as the wounded were beginning to come
into Plevna in considerable numbers, when I
saw a Turkish sergeant who had been slightly
wounded by a splinter from a shell. He announced
that he was going back to the fight,
and I said that I would go with him. I rode
out, while the sergeant followed on foot, and
passing our farthest redoubt I found myself
among some trees, with the shells flying about
in all directions. When I looked round for the
sergeant, I found that he had disappeared, and
that I was there by myself about two hundred
yards in the rear of our foremost fighting line
in the trenches. The troops were almost hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
from me by smoke, and a few wounded men
were crawling back towards the redoubt for
shelter. I formed a little field ambulance behind
the trees, and proceeded to give first aid to the
wounded; but the firing began to get so hot that
I was obliged to abandon the position and ride
back. As I crossed the Lovtcha road in the
direction of the Krishin redoubts, I came across
three or four isolated rifle pits in which a few
old Turkish civilians, armed with antiquated
rifles, were busily firing upon the Russian lines.
They had evidently not been observed by the
Russians, and the old fellows, showing nothing
but a pair of gleaming eyes and the long brown
barrels of the rifles above the level of the ground,
were knocking over their men at long range.
How on earth they got there I could not conjecture;
but they soon saw me, and resented my
appearance strongly. They called out to me in
most forcible language to take myself and my
horse away, as they were afraid that I should
draw the Russian fire upon them. I left them
still diligently potting the unconscious enemy,
and at about four o'clock in the afternoon I heard
a terrific musketry fire back towards Grivitza.
After crossing the headquarters camp I could
see dense masses of troops advancing from the
village of Grivitza, and a black cloud of men
already in the valley, about five hundred yards
in front of the Grivitza redoubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russian artillerymen were
shelling the redoubt, which was evidently in
imminent danger. The stables at the rear of
the redoubt, which were roofed with boards and
hurdles, caught fire from an exploding shell, and
blazed up as I was watching. I could hear the
Russians cheering when they saw the fire.</p>

<p>Seeing the Russians in the valley, I galloped on
the lee side of the hill, where I was under cover,
to the Grivitza redoubt. I went into the redoubt
which was being shelled, and, climbing upon the
banquette where the men were firing, I could see
large bodies of Roumanians attacking us on the
north, while a detachment of Russians were advancing
from the east. I found Sadik Pasha, who
was in command of the redoubt, and told him that
I had seen a strong body of troops in the valley
below us and invisible from the redoubt. A shell
exploded in the redoubt while I was there, and
I was glad to clear out as quickly as I could.</p>

<p>Jumping on my horse again, I galloped off to
the south, where Skobeleff was attacking the
Krishin redoubts and the neighbouring works.
As I rode across the Lovtcha road the firing was
something terrific. Skobeleff's troops had taken
the second crest of the Green Hills on the
previous day, and this morning they had taken
the third crest and driven our men back from
the trenches into the two redoubts described
afterwards by Skobeleff as the Number 1 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Number 2 Plevna redoubts. In spite of a
furious counter-attack by the Turks, the Russian
regiments remained in possession of the height,
having thus carried each successive ridge of the
Green Hills and driven our men back into the
redoubts.</p>

<p>It was now about half-past two in the afternoon,
and as I approached the rear of the two
redoubts which were the objective of the main
assault the intensity of the fire redoubled. The
Turks were running out of the back of the redoubts
in hundreds, and I tried in vain to rally
them and get them to return. I saw a Turkish
lieutenant, who was one of the fugitives, endeavouring
to climb over a paling fence at the
back of one of the redoubts and get away to
Plevna. I upbraided him, and thumped him in
vain with the flat of my sword. As he was
getting over the fence he was struck by a rifle-ball,
and fell with his back broken.</p>

<p>As I was shouting, entreating, threatening, and
striking the fugitives to try and get them to rally,
I saw two old Turkish civilians in long beards
and caftans. They came up and caught me by
both hands, saying, "Sen choki adam," which
means, "You are a noble fellow," or words to
that effect. I remember this incident because
it was one of the highest compliments I have
ever received. Troops were flying pell-mell for
Plevna, and shells were exploding at the rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of twenty or thirty per minute on the side of
the hill. The roar of the artillery, the rattle of
the musketry, the explosion of the shells, the
loud hurrahs of the Russians, and the cries of
the wounded made up a perfect hell. I met
Czetwertinski near the redoubts, and he and I
made renewed efforts to rally the men; but we
were powerless to stop the mad tide of fugitives.
Czetwertinski drove the point of his sword into
a man's leg without being able to stop him;
and at last, as it was getting hotter and hotter,
he said to me that it was hopeless stopping
there, and we had better be off.</p>

<p>As I returned to Plevna the men were flying
like wild animals. It was a regular panic. They
were like sheep before a bush-fire. When I got
into the town there was a panic among the
townspeople. A universal cry of, "The Russians
are coming! the Russians are coming!" went
up on all sides; and wounded men, old, bed-ridden,
half-naked women, and screaming children
were all crowding towards the headquarters camp.
I learnt then that Skobeleff had taken the two
redoubts within half a mile of the town, and that
the Grivitza redoubt was also in the hands of the
Russians.</p>

<p>Skobeleff, it seems, had given the order to
attack at three o'clock; and the Vladimir and
Souzdal Regiments, supported by chasseurs, rose
and rushed forward with bands playing and drums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
beating. They had to descend the wooded slopes
covered with vines from the third ridge, to enter
the valley, cross the stream at the bottom, and
climb a stiff slope, completely bare for about
seven hundred yards, on the summit of which
the redoubt was placed. The attacking force
received a terrible fire from the artillery and
infantry in the redoubt attacked, as well as an
enfilading fire from the Krishin redoubt; but
when reinforced by the Revel Regiment, they
pushed on doggedly under the hail of bullets,
which had already killed nearly half of their
number, flung themselves into the trenches, and
finally climbed the parapet and took the redoubt.
The second redoubt, which was connected with
the first, also fell immediately afterwards after
a desperate struggle.</p>

<p>Raked by the guns of the Krishin redoubts
and by the fire of the Turkish infantry, who
sallied out from the camp at the rear of these
redoubts, Skobeleff's troops had a fearful night
in the defences which they had captured.</p>

<p>Successive assaults were delivered upon them
all through the night by the Turks; but time
after time our men were driven back by the
murderous fire of the Krenke and Berdan rifles.
On the exposed side of the Number 1 redoubt
the Russians had built up a parapet of the dead
bodies of friend and foe alike; and sheltered
behind this dreadful barrier, they poured a hail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of bullets into the Turkish ranks. When morning
broke I could still hear the rattle of the rifles;
and working away in my shirt sleeves in the
hospital, I could hear the rifle-bullets pattering
on the red tiles of the houses in the town. At
daybreak I went back to my quarters for a sleep.
The Russian batteries had advanced to closer
range, and two shells exploded in my garden.
A bullet came through the door of the room
where I was lying, and buried itself in the wall
just before I fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I awoke and went out the firing was
still going on, and there were about one thousand
five hundred wounded men lying out in the open
square. We started to dress them at once. All
the wounded men who had been in the hospital
were removed for greater safety to the south end
of the town, so as to be as far away as possible
from the scene of action. We cleared out a
number of small Bulgarian hovels belonging to
people of the poorest class, and installed the
wounded in them.</p>

<p>I had not been at the hospital long before my
Circassian servant came down and informed me
that the firing at my house was getting very hot,
and he wanted to know what he should do. He
said that he thought the town was on the point
of being taken. I told him to go back, pack up
my things, and put them on my horse. I said,
"If you see the Russians coming over the crest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of the hill, come down here at once with my
horse, but not otherwise." My horse had not
come out of it scatheless, for a bullet had gone
through the muscles of his neck; but he was
still full of pluck and able to carry me well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let us see what had been happening
at the redoubts. Attack after attack was delivered
through the night without success; and at last,
at half-past ten a.m., a vigorous assault, backed
up with a telling shell fire, shook the defence,
and the Russians began to pour out of Number 1
redoubt, their example being followed by those
in the adjoining work. Some of the foremost
Turks had already penetrated into the redoubts;
but they were sacrificed in vain, for Skobeleff,
with his extraordinary personal magnetism and
great courage, rallied his men again, and staved
off the inevitable moment a little longer. I got
away from the hospital at three o'clock in the
afternoon, and rode out towards the redoubts
where the Russians were sustaining a last furious
assault by our troops under Tewfik Bey. As I
neared the redoubts this assault was at its height,
and this time the Turkish troops would not be
denied. The columns deployed under fire and
formed lines of skirmishers, who received continuous
support from fresh accessions of men
behind, carrying the assault forward in successive
waves. Soon the Turks were over the parapet
once more, cutting down the Russian defenders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and driving the remainder out on the other side
and down the slope again towards their own
trenches on the Green Hills.</p>

<p>Thus the third battle of Plevna ended, after
five days' fighting, in the complete defeat of the
Russians, who lost nearly twenty thousand men
in the long bloody struggle, and gained nothing
but the Grivitza redoubt, which was absolutely
no use to them, and which fell mainly through
the instrumentality of the Roumanian, not the
Russian, troops.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe how the Russian
official documents describe the result. "The
points chosen for attack," we read, "were the
following: the redoubt of Grivitza, the works in
the centre opposite the heights of Radishevo, and
the third crest of the Montagnes Vertes. After
superhuman efforts and enormous losses, our
troops carried the first and last of these points.
The Grivitza redoubt and two of the redoubts
south of Plevna were in our possession; as to
the central works, our troops, notwithstanding that
they showed a bravery beyond all praise, could
not carry them. Consequently we had obtained
some partial successes; but fresh troops were
necessary to profit by our gains, and these were
not forthcoming. It was decided, therefore, to
keep the Grivitza redoubt, and to abandon the
Montagnes Vertes."</p>

<p>When I think of that last tremendous charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of the Turkish infantry, when the cry of "La
ilaha illallah Mohammed Rasul Allah!" rent the
air and rang from one redoubt to the other, as it
went like the flame in a train of gunpowder round
the whole circuit of the defences, I cannot help
smiling at the polite official statement, "It was
decided to abandon the Montagnes Vertes."</p>

<p>I was inside the Number 1 redoubt two
minutes after the men of the front firing line,
and I shall never forget the scene of carnage that
I saw there. The redoubt was literally choked
up with dead and dying men, and the ground
was ankle deep in blood, brains, and mutilated
fragments of humanity. The Turks became
almost delirious with the excitement of the
victory. Everywhere men were shouting, praying,
and giving thanks to Allah. About three
hundred of them got drag-ropes, and took the
captured Russian guns off in triumph to the
headquarters camp; and inside the redoubt the
soldiers fell on each other's necks, danced, and
sang in a perfect frenzy of delight. The excitement
of the five minutes following the recapture
of the redoubts was worth a lifetime of common-place
existence; but all the while in the Grivitza
redoubt, three miles away, the enemy stood watching
with cannons ready&mdash;a silent warning of the
conflicts yet in store for us.</p>

<p>After the battle, the Russians withdrew from
their positions and retired on Radishevo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The Turkish army was mad with joy. We
attached but little importance to the capture of
the Grivitza redoubt by the Russians, because
the Turkish garrison simply fell back upon the
sister redoubt, which was only one hundred and
eighty yards distant from the other in a north-westerly
direction, and really commanded it.
The unimportance of the loss of this redoubt
was proved by the fact that, though the enemy
occupied it during the whole of the remainder
of the siege, they did little or no damage
from it.</p>

<p>On the night after the battle, the Russian
troops in the Grivitza redoubt Number 1, or
the Kanli Tabiya, made a desperate sortie with
the object of capturing the Number 2 redoubt,
or, as we called it, the Bash Tabiya.</p>

<p>It is strange how the sleeping brain adjusts itself
to circumstances&mdash;sleeps with one eye open, as it
were. I could always sleep soundly under the
fire of the heavy guns, even in a redoubt, because
my brain recognized that they were practically
harmless when we were under cover; but as soon
as the rattle of the rifles began, I invariably
awoke at once with an instinctive knowledge that
the fight was approaching a crisis. So it was on
the night after the battle. The Russian cannon
continued to boom sullenly at intervals, and,
worn out with fatigue as I was, they only lulled
me to a deeper slumber in my quarters in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
town. Presently, however, a rifle volley rang out,
quickly answered by another and another. In
a second I was out of my sheepskin rug and on
my verandah, from which I could see the night
attack three miles away. The night was dark
and drizzling; but looking in a north-easterly
direction towards the line of the Janik Bair
redoubts, I could see the flash of the volleys and
the spirting flame of the artillery as the Russians
leaped from their redoubt upon the Bash Tabiya,
only one hundred and eighty yards distant from
them. The Bash Tabiya was strongly garrisoned.
Its heavy guns swept every yard of the ground
between it and the newly captured forts; and its
defenders poured an incessant hail of bullets from
a triple line of rifle-barrels upon the attacking
troops. To succeed under such circumstances
was well nigh impossible, and after a few minutes
of this awful fire the Russian remnant broke and
fled back to the protection of the redoubt.</p>

<p>It was only on the morrow that we realized
what a complete victory we had won in the battle
of the previous day, because we could then see
plainly that the Russians had suffered terrible
losses and had achieved absolutely nothing. We
began to feel more secure of our position; and the
wounded, who had all been sent away to the lower
end of the town, were brought back again and
placed in temporary hospitals near our central
depot. In the previous battles we had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
accustomed to send the wounded away to Sofia
at once, and the wisdom of Osman Pasha's decision
in this matter was now made apparent.
Insufficient as was our hospital accommodation, it
was doubly fortunate that we were not encumbered
with the wounded from the previous battles as
well, because we now had about four thousand
patients to deal with, and there was no chance of
sending them away because we realized at last
that we were in a state of siege. The Russians
were all round Plevna, and they barred the
Orkhanieh road.</p>

<p>We of the medical staff had four days of real
hard work after the battle. There were an
immense number of operations to perform; and
as Osman Effendi and myself had to perform the
greater number of them, our energies were taxed
to the utmost. There were about forty doctors
all told in Plevna, to deal with four thousand
cases or thereabouts. Owing to the continuous
nature of the work, I never went back to my
quarters during the week after the battle, but
used to sleep at the hospital. My Circassian
servant cooked my food, such as it was, at my
house, and brought it down to me while I was
at work. As on the previous occasions, Osman
Effendi and myself performed all operations in
the open air under a big willow tree on the bank
of the Tutchenitza, and in the shadow of an old
Turkish mosque, where every evening at sundown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
an ancient priest, mounting a minaret, called the
faithful to prayer.</p>

<p>Although we were greatly assisted by the
magnificent physique of the patients, still their
extraordinary reluctance to undergo operations
perceptibly increased the average mortality.
Three days after the battle, I saw a Turkish
soldier crawling slowly along the street and
stopping every minute. He was holding some
object in his hand, and his appearance was so
strange that I went over and had a look at him.
I found that he had been shot in the abdomen,
and about two feet of the small intestine had
prolapsed, and was protruding through the
wound. It was so altered in appearance by exposure
that it looked exactly like a bit of tarred
rope. Two of this man's comrades had been
wounded, and had died in the hospital&mdash;a fact
which had made him believe that the hospital
treatment was responsible for the fatal termination
of their wounds, and he resolutely refused
to allow me to touch him with an instrument.
The intestine was not strangulated; and if he
had allowed me to open up the wound, wash it,
and replace the intestine, he would probably have
recovered. As it was, he lived for fifteen days
in that pitiable condition.</p>

<p>The stoicism of the men was truly remarkable.
A soldier was brought to me to be examined
one day, and I found that he had been skylarking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
with a comrade, who had "jobbed" him in the
stomach with his bayonet. The surgeon who
first saw him could detect only a very small
wound in the stomach, and he put a bit of plaster
over the place and sent the man away. In a
few hours' time the patient became very bad, and
I was asked to see him. I asked him at once if
he had vomited any blood; and when he replied
in the affirmative, I knew that the wall of the
abdomen had been perforated, and that his fate
was sealed. He was quite cheerful, but he died
at the end of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>As the greater part of the fighting had been
done from behind parapets or breastworks, the
majority of the wounded were shot through the
head or chest, and a large percentage of these
wounds necessarily proved fatal. There was
an infinite variety in the nature of the wounds.
One man came under my hands who received
six wounds from one bullet. The ball struck
him on the outside of the right arm between the
elbow and the shoulder, passed through the arm,
through the fleshy portions of the chest, and
through the left arm as well, leaving six distinct
bullet-holes, all of which I washed and plugged.
He made a rapid recovery, and after a few weeks
in the hospital went back to the trenches.</p>

<p>Not a single wounded Russian came into my
hands after the battle. The Russians always
carried their wounded with them when they retired;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and after the crowning episode of the battle,
when I reached the Kavanlik redoubt as soon
as Tewfik Bey had recaptured it, there was not
a single living Russian left there. When the
final assault was delivered, a Russian captain and
eighteen men elected to see it out to the bitter
end. Those brave men continued fighting to
the last, and were all bayoneted by the Turkish
troops who poured, victorious at last, over the
parapet. It can readily be imagined that fighting
of this sanguinary character left few wounded
Russians for us to deal with.</p>

<p>The staff at the principal operating hospital
included, besides Osman Effendi and myself,
Weinberger, Kustler, Gebhardt, Kronberg,
Waldemann, and Rookh. We had also a lot of
jarra bashis with a rudimentary idea of surgery
to assist us. Each man brought to us for an
operation had to wait his turn, and such was the
pressure of the work that many of the poor
fellows were kept there for four or five days
before we could attend to them. Still, at this
period a large percentage recovered from their
wounds, owing principally to the fact that the
accommodation was not overcrowded and that we
had few cases of septic disease. We were able
to give them a liberal diet, as we had plenty of
broth, milk, rice, and biscuits. These biscuits
when soaked and steamed proved most useful.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha has been liberally accused of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
inhuman neglect towards the wounded; but those
accusations have been made against him by
people who had no opportunity of forming an
accurate judgment, and who mistook his inflexible
determination to get the wounded away from
Plevna for cruelty and want of consideration for
their sufferings. I had many opportunities of
observing the Muchir during my stay in Plevna,
and I can definitely refute these charges of
neglect and apathy in the presence of anguish.
Unsparing of his troops in battle, Osman Pasha
never forgot his wounded men when the fighting
was over. At this period, after the third battle,
he constantly visited the hospitals, encouraging
the wounded by his presence and by his kindly
words. He let it be understood, too, that all
those members of the medical staff who worked
well would be decorated; and it is only bare
justice to say that all of them cheerfully performed
long hours of very hard work on insufficient
food and with little or no sleep during
the trying days and nights that followed upon
our greatest victory.</p>

<p>When the brunt of the work was over, I went
back to my quarters, and Czetwertinski and Victor
Lauri went with me&mdash;Czetwertinski because he
was very delicate, and Lauri because he had no
servant of his own, and did not know where else
to go. About four days after the battle, Czetwertinski,
who was in touch with the headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
staff, heard that Osman Pasha was looking for
some one who would endeavour to run the
gauntlet of the Russians, posted all round Plevna,
and carry his despatches to Constantinople. The
gallant young Pole brought me the news, and
asked me if I would join him in an attempt to get
through with the papers. We sat up most of the
night talking the matter over, and Czetwertinski
carefully explained to me that, while we should
certainly be hanged if we fell into the hands of
the Russians, we should be rewarded with the
highest decorations if we were successful in the
attempt.</p>

<p>We agreed to offer our services as despatch-carriers
to Osman Pasha, and next morning
Czetwertinski waited on the commander-in-chief
and formally represented our decision. Osman
Pasha thanked us warmly, but declined our offer,
preferring to entrust the task to a Circassian,
who, being more intimately acquainted with the
country, would stand a better chance of getting
through the enemy's lines.</p>

<p>Gay, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> correspondent, however,
was extremely anxious to get away. He
had shut himself up in his own room as soon as
the battle was over, and had been writing all
day and all night ever since, preparing a glowing
description of the stirring events which had taken
place. He had completed a fine budget of
work, and was naturally burning to get it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
his paper; for it meant a great journalistic coup
for the <i>Telegraph</i>, as Gay was the only correspondent
with the Turkish army, though Forbes,
MacGahan, and many others were with the
Russians. The first step was to engage a guide,
and Gay selected a smart young Circassian, who
willingly undertook the job for the munificent
reward of three thousand piastres, which he was
promised as soon as Sofia was reached. Sitting
in his room in Plevna, Gay wound up his
despatch for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> by describing
his plans for getting it to Sofia. "To-day,
September 15," he wrote, "the cannonade goes
forward languidly, nor is it at all likely that it
will end so long as the Russians have a gun or
a man anywhere near us. But it is comparatively
harmless, so far as affecting the Turkish
position goes, and will some day, when Osman
Pasha is reinforced, as he shortly will be, come
to an untimely end. For my own part I am
about to endeavour to-night to break the blockade
which surrounds Plevna. For two days I have
sought for Circassians who would undertake the
task of piloting me over the mountains in the
dark and failed. Last evening Osman Pasha
found a one-eyed chieftain, who with a comrade
has engaged to conduct me if the feat is at all
practicable, and according to present arrangements
I am to start to-night about the time it
begins to get dark. Mr. Victor Lauri too is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
anxious to go with me; and a Turkish officer also
desires to be one of the party, which will thus
consist of two Circassians, a Turkish sergeant,
and my servant, an Ionian lad, a Greek groom,
Mr. Lauri, the Turkish officer, and myself&mdash;in all
a party of eight well armed. At the moment of
my writing the Circassians and the Greek are out
on a voyage of exploration, with a view to seeing
whether there is the possibility of our accomplishing
the task, in which case they will be back
by evening ready to pilot us. As the risk is
great, the Circassians are to be amply rewarded
directly Sofia is reached, that is, if the work be
faithfully done, and upon their report now all
rests. For myself I am determined to go if
they will take me. What the result will be time
alone can show. But if you get this letter
safely, I shall have run the gauntlet, and will
then telegraph you the history of our risky ride
across country."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Gay did not start on that
night. Czetwertinski and I went out with him
to the outposts to see him off; but it was plain
that the psychological moment was not yet. It
was a bright moonlight night, and we could see
the Russian vedettes sitting on their horses all
round us. A cat could not have got through the
lines without being seen, let alone a man on
horseback; and the captain in command of our
outpost absolutely refused to allow the attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
be made, pointing out that it meant certain capture
and death for all the party.</p>

<p>On the following night, however, Gay and his
escort got away. We heard afterwards that they
had a lively time of it, for they were chased by
Cossacks, and fired on repeatedly by startled
Russian sentries. It was only through the speed
and bottom of their horses that they reached
Orkhanieh in safety, and thence made their way
to Sofia. Gay had a quarrel with Lauri before
he went, and the result was that the little German
artist stayed behind with me.</p>

<p>Amid the recollection of all those scenes of bloodshed,
the memory of the little German artist's
yearning for the unattainable stands out clear
and distinct. It was connected with a German
sausage; but in order to make the matter plain, it
is necessary to point out that Gay and Lauri had
expended about thirty pounds in equipping a
private commissariat department before they came
to Plevna. In Constantinople they had bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
provisions of all kinds: English kippered herrings,
American canned beef, potted vegetables of
strange and fearful hues, portable meat lozenges,
and last, but not least, a magnificent German
sausage&mdash;not one of those insignificant cylinders
of suspicious ingredients which are exposed for
sale in the piping times of peace, but a sausage
which was constructed, so to speak, on a war
footing. It was about four feet long and one foot
six inches in circumference, and it was enclosed
in a metal case of the kind generally used to
carry maps and charts. This noble specimen
of <i>wurst</i> was the apple of little Lauri's artistic
eye. But, alas! I was ignorant of this. Before
Gay went away, being incensed with Lauri over
some trivial dispute, he presented me with the remains
of the commissariat, which, it appeared, had
been bought with his money, and which included
the famous sausage. He also gave me several
other things, including a capital bell tent, which, I
am sorry to say, was afterwards stolen from me.</p>

<p>However, when I got this sausage Lauri was
away, camping, I fancy, in one of the redoubts,
and I at once invited every good fellow that I
knew in the place to come to the banquet. We
had two meals off it, and then&mdash;where, oh, where
was that triumph of the sausage-maker's art?
"Where," asks that inspired bard Hans Breitmann,
"is dat little cloud that fringed the mountain
brow?" We procured some raki, the pungent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Turkish spirit which burns a hole in the membrane
of the throat as it passes down, and we
had dinner. Then we procured some more
raki, and we had supper. After that we looked
round for the sausage; but it was gone&mdash;"gone
where the woodbine twineth." Lauri came
back to my quarters next day, and behaved
with contumely when invited to sit down to our
usual fare of boiled beans and rice. He consigned
every individual boiled bean in Turkey
to a place where it would soon become unpleasantly
scorched, and then he mourned for
the sausage, which he believed Gay had eaten
in the silence of the night all by himself. "If
only he had left me my peautiful sausage!" he
wailed, while I said never a word, but only
winked at Czetwertinski. When Lauri had continued
every day for a week making lamentation
over the loss of that satisfying yard and a quarter
of food, I broke the news gently to him that we
had eaten it in his absence. Contrary to my
expectation, he was not seized with an apoplectic
attack, and at last even became reconciled again
to the "verdammte poiled peans."</p>

<p>One day when I rode up to the headquarters
camp at about two o'clock in the afternoon, I
found the whole place in a simmer of suppressed
excitement, and addressed myself to Tewfik
Pasha, who had been promoted to that rank after
the battle, in order to ascertain the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the commotion. He told me that the Russians
had sent forward a <i>parlementaire</i> to invite Osman
Pasha or some officer representing him to meet a
Russian general at a certain place and discuss
a matter of interest to both. I asked what the
subject of discussion was to be, and Tewfik
replied that he did not know. He also told me
that Osman Pasha wished to go himself, but that
his staff were endeavouring to dissuade him,
pointing out to him that he would impair his
dignity by consenting to meet any officer of
lower grade than the commander-in-chief of the
Russian army, who at this time was Prince
Charles of Roumania.</p>

<p>As I sat on my horse at the headquarters camp
I saw that Osman Pasha was ready to start. His
best horse, a magnificent chestnut charger with a
saddlecloth heavily embroidered with gold, was
champing the bit in front of the Muchir's tent,
and presently Osman Pasha emerged, dressed in
his full State uniform, and actually wearing, what
I should never have expected to see in Plevna
at that grim period, a pair of white kid gloves.
It was arranged that if he went he should be
accompanied by Tewfik Pasha.</p>

<p>At the last moment, however, Osman Pasha
yielded to the advice of his staff, and decided to
remain behind; so Tewfik Pasha and Czetwertinski
went forward with a small escort. They rode
out about a mile and a half from Plevna, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
they met two Russian officers, and after an
elaborate exchange of polite courtesies the business
of the conference was broached. It appeared
that during the attack on the Grivitza redoubt
and the subsequent night attack on the Bash
Tabiya many hundreds of men had been killed;
and as the Grivitza redoubt remained in the
hands of the Russians, and the Bash redoubt,
only one hundred and eighty yards away, was still
held by the Turks, the corpses both of Turks and
Russians which lay between the two works had
been left unburied, with the result that the stench
had become almost unbearable, and was a serious
annoyance to the defenders of both forts. The
Russian officers politely pointed out that a removal
of the nuisance would be as welcome to
them as it would be to the Turks, and courteously
offered to send out a burial party and inter all
the bodies lying between the Grivitza and the
Bash redoubts, if the occupants of the latter work
would incommode themselves so far as to abstain
from potting at the military gravediggers while
they were pursuing their melancholy occupation.
Tewfik Pasha and Czetwertinski begged that the
Russian officers would excuse them for a moment
while they considered the subject, and then, after
a brief consultation in Turkish, Czetwertinski as
spokesman took up his parable in reply. It was
with feelings of the most profound regret, he
explained, that Tewfik Pasha was obliged to deny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
himself the pleasure of accepting the generous
offer of the Russians. Certainly the odour from
the ill fated corpses, both of the Turks and of
their so gallant and courageous assailants, was
decidedly offensive; but it would not be fair to
allow the Russians to incur the whole of the
annoyance which would attach to the burial of
so many patriots who had fallen on the field of
honour. In effect he would propose as an alternative
that if the Russians would inconvenience
themselves to the extent of sending out a party
of men to bury all the corpses within ninety yards
of their redoubt, the Turks on their side would
feel it a pleasure and an honour to bury all the
bodies within a similar distance of the work which
they occupied. Thus the labour would be equally
divided and the interment carried out most
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The wily Tewfik had seen at a glance the
object of the Russians in proposing this generous
action. If they had been allowed to advance
one hundred and twenty yards from their redoubt
on the pretence of burying the bodies, they would
surmount the crest of the hill, and would be able
to see into Plevna, besides securing most valuable
observations as to the position of the various
defences. Hence his polite reply.</p>

<p>The Russian officers were overwhelmed of
course with admiration for the generous proposal
made by Tewfik Pasha, but were desolated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
their inability to accept it. After further parleying
in the same strain it was plain that the <i>parlementaires</i>
would be unable to come to terms, so
the Russians produced a flask of excellent brandy
which they pressed upon their visitors. Tewfik
Pasha did not drink, but Czetwertinski politely
drained a glass to the health of his entertainers,
and all sat down for a few minutes' pleasant chat
about the weather and the crops, the latest story
from the clubs, and the legs of the last new ballet-dancer
at the Paris opera-house. Then Tewfik
Pasha took out his watch, and thought that it
was really time to be going; so the Russian
officers bowed, and wished their visitors <i>au revoir</i>,
while Tewfik Pasha and Czetwertinski with their
escort of a couple of troopers trotted back towards
the Turkish lines. It is pleasant to reflect that
the disagreeable necessities of war cannot blunt
the exquisite politeness of true diplomacy.</p>

<p>Day by day the Russians, who were beginning
to recover their lost <i>morale</i>, worked up closer and
closer towards our entrenchments. Taught by
the example of their adversaries, they began to
make a more extensive use of the entrenching
spade which had already revolutionized the art
of warfare; and seeing the completeness with
which the Turks protected themselves by means
of the shield which they carried with them, the
Russians too rapidly adopted the same practice.</p>

<p>One morning the Russian outposts were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
close to our lines that they could see our men
laying out fresh lines of shelter trenches, and
working parties commencing their tasks with a
will. Skobeleff accompanied by his staff, was
examining these works, and, feeling irritated by
the tenacity of the Turks, he ordered a gun to
be brought up to the outposts. The gun was
placed in position, and fired several rounds of
case shot at the working parties, killing a couple
of men and wounding three others. Our fellows
replied energetically, and the workers presently
returned to their burrowing with fresh zest.</p>

<p>Day and night a desultory bombardment continued.
During the night the Russians used to
fire from ten to twenty shells into the town, and
at intervals during the day also the shells arrived,
knocking down a few houses and killing a good
many men, more Bulgarians, however, than Turks.</p>

<p>Very shortly after the battle we found that
the 4th division of the Roumanian army was
entrenched about six hundred yards to the east
of the Bash Tabiya. Owing to the terrible stench
caused by the dead bodies which lay unburied,
we had to change the entire garrison of the Bash
Tabiya, numbering four thousand men in all, every
forty-eight hours; and as the approach to the Bash
Tabiya was exposed for about thirty yards to the
fire of the Russians, the operation of relieving
the guard was always exciting.</p>

<p>I often paid a visit to the Bash Tabiya in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
afternoon to have a cup of coffee and a cigarette
with old Sadik Pasha, who was in command, and
these afternoon calls were always attended with
a certain amount of risk. The fellows in the Grivitza
redoubt used to keep a look out for visitors;
but the range was over eight hundred yards, and
I used to skip across those thirty yards of exposed
space, dodging like a strong blue rock before the
barrels of the pigeon-shooter, and always coming
through safely. It did not take me more than
three seconds to cover the distance, and before
they could sight their rifles I was across.</p>

<p>At about three o'clock every afternoon Ahmet
brought my horse down to the hospital, and I
went for a ride out to the redoubts, and paid my
respects to one or other of the commanders.
One day a Turkish major in one of them consulted
me about an eruption on his chin. He
was mightily concerned about it, and I promised
to bring him some ointment to allay the unpleasant
symptoms. As a matter of fact, I
believe it was barber's itch that he had. Accordingly
I rode out on the following day with the
ointment to the redoubt, which was commanded
by a Russian redoubt built on the slope of a hill
about a thousand yards away. As I got up to
our redoubt there were three soldiers sitting on
the rear wall smoking cigarettes, and I called
to one of them to come and hold my horse. The
one who came was a magnificently built fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
He was in great good humour, laughing and
chatting with his comrades, and he came out of
the redoubt and held my bridle while I walked
into the work. As I did so the officer in command
of the Russian redoubt, seeing a horseman
approaching the work opposite to him, thought
that it would be good fun to have a shot at him;
so he let drive at me with three field-guns. I
saw the three puffs of smoke together as I walked
into the redoubt. One shell buried itself in the
front wall of the redoubt without exploding,
another burst in the redoubt, and the third passed
over the redoubt and exploded just behind it.
The casing of the shell that exploded inside
wounded a man in the heel, taking half the boot
off and cutting the heel to the bone. He was a
black soldier, a Nubian. I was looking after
him, when some one called out to me to come
outside; and the first thing I saw was my horse
quietly grazing about fifty yards at the rear of the
redoubt. The man who had been holding him
had been cut in two by the third shell. He was
quite dead. I went back into the redoubt, and
dressed the Nubian's heel. Then the Turkish
major and I had coffee and cigarettes together,
and I gave him the ointment for his chin, whereat
he was much gratified. We were so much accustomed
to whole hecatombs of victims in those
days, that we were callous to a single casualty.</p>

<p>We were beginning to get a little short of food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in Plevna; and though I was not very particular
about my cuisine and got on fairly well on boiled
beans and rice, I felt sorry for poor Czetwertinski,
who had been very bad with dysentery, and for
whom I prescribed nourishing food in vain, for
there was no one to make up the prescription.
However, one morning I noticed a fine flock of
geese in the yard of a Bulgarian house between
my place and the hospital, so I approached the
proprietor with an eye to purchase. He was a
sour-tempered fellow; and though I offered him
a medjidie apiece for the geese, he declined to
trade. When I got home again that night and
sat down to more boiled beans, I casually mentioned
to Ahmet that there were a nice lot of
geese in a Bulgarian house not far away. Next
night all the geese were in our yard. I did not
inquire too closely the motive which impelled the
toothsome birds to seek for change of scene; but
it flashed across me that Ahmet and his mate
Faizi were young and strong, and also that they
were Circassians. We ate four of the geese in
our house, and gave the rest away to my brother
surgeons. There were a dozen of them originally,
and I sent the Bulgarian goose-farmer a
couple of Turkish liras for them, so that he did
not do so badly after all out of his forced sale.</p>

<p>Although big engagements seemed at an end
for the present, and the Russians evidently
intended to starve us out, instead of attempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to take Plevna by assault, still we had plenty of
casual skirmishes to keep us in form and remind
us that we were not at a picnic. Towards the
end of September, Mustapha Bey was ordered
to go out with a squadron of cavalry across the
Vid and reconnoitre the Sofia road, to see what
sort of a force the Russians had placed there.
I was a great favourite with old Mustapha, and
he made an application to Osman Pasha that I
should be allowed to accompany the column.</p>

<p>Permission was readily granted, and one beautiful
morning I found myself cantering out of
Plevna, with Mustapha Bey and Czetwertinski
at the head of a troop of four hundred regular
cavalry and three hundred Circassians. We
rode out to the foot of the Janik Bair colline
below Opanetz, and from that point we could
see the village of Dolni-Netropol, about a mile
away.</p>

<p>As we were riding towards that village the troop
suddenly halted, and Czetwertinski declared that
he could make out a regiment of infantry drawn
up about three-quarters of a mile away. We
held a consultation, and Czetwertinski said that
he could see a battery of Russian artillery in
position as well. I had a great reputation for
being sharp-sighted in those days, and was
generally the first to see the enemy; but I fancied
that what Czetwertinski saw was really a herd of
the small black cattle of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait here a moment while I go on and have
a look," I shouted; and sticking the spurs into
my horse, I galloped forward by myself.</p>

<p>When I had gone about two hundred yards, I
caught sight of a Russian vedette, galloping for
his life towards Netropol. The Circassians saw
him too, and in a second they were after him
like greyhounds coursing a hare. The whole
troop followed them; but before we had gone
a furlong we heard the sharp crack of the rifles,
and the piff-paff of the bullets striking the
ground all round us.</p>

<p>Old Mustapha was taken by surprise, and
was quite disconcerted for the moment; but we
galloped on to the next ridge, and we found
that the Circassians had thrown themselves on
the ground at the top of the ridge in skirmishing
order, and were busily blazing at a Russian
cavalry regiment about five hundred yards away.
We all took up the same order, lying down and
firing away as fast as we could pull our triggers
at the dense masses of the enemy scarcely a
quarter of a mile away. I was on the extreme
right, and I kept at it with my Winchester,
vaguely wondering how long that sort of thing
could last before we were driven back by the
vastly outnumbering Russian force.</p>

<p>The fusillade only lasted about ten minutes;
but during that time no fewer than thirteen
Russian horses came galloping towards us riderless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
showing that we had emptied that number
of saddles at least. The Russians were giving
us volley after volley; but they had not got the
range, and our casualties were few.</p>

<p>I saw a very fine roan charger, which had lost
his rider, come galloping towards us; and I
started out to catch him, reckoning that he would
do capitally for an extra mount, and to give my
own horse a spell. Circassians, however, are
keen judges of a horse, and a fellow on my left
started out at the same time as I did and with
the same object. It was a curious experience to
be dodging bullets between the two lines; but
the prize was worth the risk. However, when
the roan saw the Circassian and myself running
up with outstretched arms to stop him, he took
fright, and, wheeling round, galloped back to his
own lines, sending the earth flying behind him
in all directions. The Circassian and I, looking
rather sheepish, bolted back to the cover of the
friendly ridge, which we both reached in safety.
We only had two casualties so far. One man
was shot through the thigh and another through
the shoulder. I treated them both on the spot;
but the man who was wounded in the shoulder
died almost immediately.</p>

<p>The Russians brought up their infantry and
artillery, and we retired as hard as we could upon
the village of Netropol with the enemy in hot
pursuit. We were only a handful, and things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
were looking pretty serious, when, to my great
relief, I heard the boom of answering artillery
and caught the sound of shells screaming overhead.
I found that we were under the protection
of our own guns, which commanded the whole
of the plain, and had opened on the advancing
Russians. We exchanged a few shots in the
main street of Netropol, a dirty little Bulgarian
village from which the population had fled; and
at one time the Russians were so close to us
that we fired our revolvers at them. We retreated
towards our own lines, and the Russians
dispersed under the fire of our artillery.</p>

<p>As we were riding back to Plevna, we looked
down towards the Sofia road about a mile away,
and saw a long train of arabas winding along
like an enormous snake towards Plevna. This
was the great train of provisions and supplies
of all sorts that Hakki Pasha brought up from
Sofia and Orkhanieh, opening up communication
again with Plevna, and forcing a passage through
the Russian opposition with reinforcements of
six thousand fresh troops. The train of arabas
was more than a mile long, and the extent of
the convoy may be gauged from the fact that
there were about three hundred waggons full of
ammunition, rations, drugs, and medical stores.</p>

<p>As we were watching the train winding along
the road, a trooper came galloping up and told
Mustapha Bey that a couple of Russian regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
had swooped down upon the tail end of the
convoy, shot a few men, and captured thirty
waggons full of stores. We were ordered to
go in pursuit, and away we went at a gallop, with
the object of intercepting the Russian cutting-out
party and recapturing the precious supplies.
On the way we surprised a squadron of about
sixty Russian cavalry who were camping in a
maize-field. They had dismounted, and were
resting when we came suddenly upon them; but
they had time to mount and gallop off, many of
them leaving their carbines behind in their hurry.
As the cutting-out party had rejoined their main
body, it was hopeless for us to attempt to
recapture the waggons, and we had to return
reluctantly to Plevna. It was a fairly exciting
day's work, taking it all through, and when I got
back I had spent fourteen hours continuously in
the saddle.</p>

<p>We settled down to the routine of camp life
afresh, with the prospect of a long winter siege
before us, and I was much disheartened to find
that our stock of medical supplies was already
almost exhausted, and that there was no chance
of replenishing them. The stock of drugs,
bandages, and other appliances intended for our
hospitals was unfortunately contained in the thirty
waggons which the Russians carried off.</p>

<p>Although the prospect was gloomy enough, the
troops continued in excellent spirits, and some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the daily incidents of the siege were decidedly
humorous. Two days after the Netropol expedition
I was riding out towards the Lovtcha road
with Czetwertinski, when we came upon a party
of about a dozen Turks jabbering away in a
great state of excitement. They had got something
with them, and from a distance I thought
that they had caught a hare, but when we rode
up we found that it was a Russian hussar. He
spoke to Czetwertinski in Russian and told his
story. It seemed that he was with his company
when he got some vodka, and imbibed so freely
that he speedily became drunk and went to sleep.
When he woke up, he had not the faintest idea
where he was, and, missing his company, walked
right into our outposts, where the men on duty
collared him. He was still very drunk when we
saw him, and he regarded his adventure as a
capital joke. The Turks had treated him very
well, and he was smoking cigarettes which they
had given him, surveying his captors with the
fatuous smile of semi-inebriety, while they in their
turn laughed heartily over their strange find. In
due course he was escorted into Plevna, and
lodged in durance as a prisoner of war. I never
heard what became of him afterwards; but he was
doubtless more comfortable than in the Russian
trenches.</p>

<p>We were in hopes that we should be able to
get our wounded men away from Plevna now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
that the road had been opened, and Osman Pasha
sent orders to the medical quarters for us to
select all the men who were able to travel.
However, before we could get them ready the
Russians barred the road again with a strong
force, and once more we were in a state of siege.
During the two days that the road was open,
however, I sent Czetwertinski away invalided to
Constantinople, and with him the German artist
Victor Lauri. It was a very good thing for
Czetwertinski that he left Plevna when he did,
for as a Russian subject it would have gone hard
with him when the Russians finally took the
town. When the war was over, Czetwertinski
met Skobeleff at San Stefano and lunched with
him. Over the coffee and cigars the conversation
naturally turned upon the recent experiences of
both, and Czetwertinski ventured to ask his host
with a smile what would have happened if they
had met earlier.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Skobeleff pleasantly, "we knew
that you were in Plevna all the time, and we
were always on the look out for you. If I
had happened to come across you there, I should
have had you shot of course."</p>

<p>Kronberg was one of the most companionable
of my medical colleagues. He was a regular
dare-devil, always ready for any adventure; and
one afternoon he and I decided to go and pay
a visit to the Bash Tabiya, the second redoubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
opposite Grivitza which commanded the main
Grivitza redoubt, at this time in the hands of the
Russians. We rode up the slope of the Janik
Bair, tied our horses to a tree under cover from
the enemy's fire, and advanced cautiously over
the exposed ground. We had to run the gauntlet
as usual for about thirty yards; and though it did
not take us more than three or four seconds,
several bullets whistled past us from the Russian
works. They used to watch the exposed space
with field-glasses, and never missed an opportunity
of having a "pot" at any one who showed himself
either there or above the parapets of the redoubt
or trenches. Our men of course used to return
the compliment from the Bash Tabiya. When
Kronberg and I had safely passed this dangerous
Tom Tiddler's ground, we struck the trenches in
which my regiment was encamped, facing north,
and I went to call on my colonel. I found him
living like a prehistoric troglodyte in a neatly
dug hole in the ground about four hundred yards
from the redoubt. The hole was connected by a
trench with the redoubt, so that the colonel could
go forward and come back without drawing the
fire of the enemy's rifles. It was about seven
feet deep, and comfortably furnished with Turkish
rugs and brightly coloured praying-mats to keep
out the damp. After a cup of coffee and a chat,
I walked along the connecting trench, which was
about six feet deep, and wide enough to allow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
men to move about freely. In the clay inner
walls tiers of bunks had been hollowed out like
sleeping-berths on board ship, and the "watch
below" were lying asleep, wrapped in their great-coats
and looking like mummies, while the watch
on deck kept their eyes open for squalls. Steps
were constructed to enable the firing parties to
aim over the parapet, and taking off my fez so
as not to attract fire I cautiously peered over the
parapet. I took up a rifle and had a few shots
without seeing the result, and then I walked on
through the trench and entered the redoubt.
The first sight that met my eyes was a gruesome
one, for the bodies of ten men who had been
killed that day were lying at the entrance awaiting
burial.</p>

<p>On my way to Sadik Pasha's abode I saw
a Turkish soldier wearing a very fine pair of
Russian high boots that had evidently belonged
to a Russian officer, and without inquiring too
closely how they had been procured I proceeded
to do a deal. My own boots were thin patent
leather riding-boots, which looked very nice, but
were quite unsuitable for walking; so I persuaded
the Turk to accept them, together with three
piastres, or sixpence, in return for the more useful
if less ornamental pair. The faithful servant of
the Prophet was delighted with his bargain, and
strutted about in my fashionable Bond Street
patent leathers admiring himself, while I, for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
part, had changed my nationality by stepping
literally into the boots of a Russian.</p>

<p>Old Sadik Pasha gave me a warm welcome.
I found him squatting on his haunches, with a
praying-mat under him, looking the picture of
contented cheerfulness. As the weather was
pretty hot, he had rigged an awning over the top
of his subterranean domicile to keep the sun off,
and Kronberg and I squatted down beside him
to hear all the news.</p>

<p>It was like dropping in to see a man at his
club&mdash;with one or two slight differences. Sadik
Pasha ordered coffee for three; and though we
were six feet underground, the Roumanians in
the Grivitza redoubt must have divined instinctively
that we were having refreshments, for they
decided to serve dessert. Finding it impossible
to do much with the ordinary shells, they had
pressed a mortar into the service, and just as the
man was coming with the coffee they fired another
projectile from this ingenious engine of warfare.
Now the specific charm of the mortar is that it
throws a shell with a very high trajectory, so
that the projectile can soar like a hawk into the
heavens and swoop down perpendicularly upon
its prey. With all their ingenuity the Turks had
not succeeded in devising a protection from this
mode of annoyance; and as the Turkish soldier
was coming along like a well drilled waiter with
a tray on his arm containing three cups of coffee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the mortar-shell exploded in the redoubt. No
one was killed, but a fragment of the casing
knocked the tray and the cups and saucers into
smithereens, and Sadik Pasha had to order
"The same again, please." This time the coffee
reached the consumer without any interruption
in transit; and I was in the act of drinking mine
when another shell exploded in the redoubt about
ten feet distant from where we were sitting, and
made a hole in the ground big enough to bury a
man in. I was so startled that I poured the
greater part of my coffee over my breeches
instead of into my mouth, and old Sadik Pasha
chuckled mightily over my want of <i>sang-froid</i>.
He gave me a cordial invitation to come and
stop with him for a week, assuring me that I
would soon get used to little accidents like that.</p>

<p>I was too polite to tell Sadik Pasha that, much
as I liked his company, the smell round his house
was so unpleasant that I felt obliged to decline
his invitation. Owing to the inability of the
<i>parlementaires</i> to come to terms at the conference
which I have already described, the bodies of the
Turks and Russians lying between Sadik's redoubt
and the Grivitza work remained unburied, and the
stench was so terrible that Kronberg was actually
sick while we were calling on our hardy little
entertainer, and I myself was very nearly guilty
of the same solecism.</p>

<p>Owing to the vigilance of <i>nos amis les ennemis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
who saluted us so warmly on our arrival at
the redoubt, Kronberg and I prolonged our
call until it was dusk, and amused ourselves as
well as we could in the redoubt. Occasionally
we elevated a fez on a bayonet, and drew the fire
of a dozen Roumanian rifles at once. Then we
returned the compliment with much <i>empressement</i>.
In this pleasant interchange of civilities the day
wore to a close; and when it was dark we said
<i>au revoir</i> to Sadik Pasha, slipped out at the
back, found our horses, and rode into the town
again.</p>

<p>Kronberg was, as I have said, a capital fellow,
plucky as a lion and generous to a fault. He
hated the Bulgarians bitterly, but never allowed
his detestation of them as a class to outweigh his
sense of justice. There was a Bulgarian of some
rank and standing in Plevna whom Osman Pasha
suspected of allowing his Russophile inclinations
to go too far. In fact, the Muchir believed that
the man was a Russian spy, and he gave orders
to have him shot. Kronberg and Rookh were
quartered in this Bulgarian's house; and when the
sentence was made known, the man's wife went
to them in a terrible state of grief and anxiety,
imploring them on her knees to save her husband,
and swearing with the most solemn protestations
that he was absolutely innocent. Kronberg and
Rookh were of the same opinion; and knowing
that I had a little influence with the headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
staff, they came to me and asked me to see
Osman Pasha on the subject, and ask him to
reconsider his decision. Osman Pasha listened
to my representations very courteously, and I
was so far successful that he consented to the
man being simply locked up instead of being
shot. The Bulgarian's life was spared, and he
was sent down as a prisoner to Constantinople
when the road was opened up by Chefket Pasha.</p>

<p>It was at this period that my hospital work,
which had previously proceeded on regulated
lines, with a hopeful measure of success attending
my efforts, began to degenerate into a desperate,
single-handed struggle against wounds, want,
filth, disease, and death.</p>

<p>I was sent to take charge of a large building
which had been converted into a hospital, and
was already overcrowded with the most pitiable
cases. The building stood in several acres of
ground on the bank of the Tutchenitza, and about
a quarter of a mile from the town, up stream.
It had previously been occupied by a wealthy
Turk, and consisted really of two large houses,
one behind the other, and connected by a passage.
The house in the rear had been the harem, while
the one in front had been occupied by the old
Turk and the male members of the household.
There was a small well kept garden leading
up to the central entrance, and a picket fence
with a gate shut it off from the road. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
were two large rooms, one on each side of the
front door, and two more behind the staircase,
with others upstairs and in the building attached
at the rear. Altogether there must have been
about twelve large rooms, high, fairly well
ventilated, and whitewashed; but more than half
of them had no beds, and the forms of the tortured
soldiers were huddled together in their clothes
on the bare boards. When I went there first,
I had two hundred and fifty men to look after,
and the task appeared such a hopeless one
that my heart sank within me.</p>

<p>We had a hundred beds in the hospital, and
a small supply of extra mattresses and blankets;
but those were soon apportioned, and for the
other unfortunates nothing remained but to lie
huddled up on the floor in the clothes in which
they had been shot. They lay on the floor of
the passages as well as in the rooms, and were
packed so closely that it was most difficult to
pick one's way through the hospital without
treading on them. In one room, fifteen feet by
fifteen feet, I had sixteen men, all hideously
wounded, dying hard on the hard boards. The
bare, whitewashed walls were splashed with blood,
which had turned to rusty dark brown stains,
and the horrors of the place can only be faintly
hinted at. I was the only medical man on
duty in that hospital, with a couple of jarra bashis,
or dispensers, to assist in dressing, and a squad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of Turkish soldiers as hospital nurses. I had
chloroform, it is true, but no other drugs of
any kind; for the first supply of medicines, as I
have explained before, fell into the hands of the
Russians when they captured the tail waggons
of the convoy. Worse than all, I saw with dismay
that the stock of antiseptic dressings was
giving out, and that unless it could be replenished
the fearful scourge of hospital gangrene was
already threatening us closely.</p>

<p>In the large room in which sixty men were lying,
some on stretcher-beds, some on mattresses, and
many on the floor, the boards were covered with
blood and filth like a shambles. Round many
of the sufferers pools of pus had formed on
the floor, and the smell was terrible. Here,
where these brave men were dying, the atmosphere
was intolerable, stifling, asphyxiating.
As their eyes roamed round that house of suffering
instinctively searching for relief, they rested
at intervals on small glass windows set high
up in the staring whitewashed wall. Through
the latticed panes they could see small squares
of far blue sky, and now and then there flitted
past one of the white doves that Moslems regard
as sacred, on its way to the willows on the bank
of the Tutchenitza.</p>

<p>Presently the antiseptic dressings were exhausted
altogether, and I had to fall back upon
coloured prints from the bazaars for bandages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and to plug the wounds with plain cotton-wool,
of which we had a large supply. This was
non-absorbent, and naturally when treated in
this way the wounds became frightfully repulsive.
It was impossible to keep the tissues healthy,
and all I could do was to go round on my
hands and knees from one man to another, literally
scraping the maggots out of the wounds either
with my finger or an instrument. The unfortunate
men were saturated with blood and pus
from their wounds, and covered with maggots
which lodged in the festering tissues. Often
and often, as I went round the "wards"&mdash;save
the mark&mdash;plodding on almost in despair against
the dreadful odds, I have taken the plugging of
cotton-wool out of a gaping wound, and found
underneath it a nest of maggots, feeding on the
flesh of the still living man, who would thank
me with a look for temporarily relieving him of
the torture.</p>

<p>In one small ward with five beds in it, I had
five men who were the finest specimens of
humanity that I ever saw in my life. I became
greatly attached to them, as they did also to
me; and it was pathetic to see their gratitude
for the most trifling service. One of them,
with his strong aquiline face and piercing eyes,
reminded me very much of a statue of Dante
which I had seen in the market-place of Verona.
My patient had been shot through the thigh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
The bone had been dreadfully smashed, and the
whole leg was a mass of gangrened flesh. If
I could have operated, I might have saved his
life; but without antiseptic dressings, and without
the possibility of subsequent careful nursing, an
operation was out of the question, and I had
to watch him suffering day by day dying literally
by inches.</p>

<p>In the next bed was an Asiatic Turk, whose
wound was a peculiar one. A rifle-bullet had
struck the top of his skull, and cut a groove
longitudinally from front to back through it. I
could do but little for the man, except to keep
the wound as clean as possible, and the poor
fellow suffered great pain. He used to be continually
telling me of his wife and children, in
some distant Anatolian village, which he knew
he would never see again, and he was very
grateful for a sympathetic listener. I was always
afraid of brain trouble developing, and after
about a week of suffering he became delirious
through inflammation of the membranes of the
brain, and died at last in fearful convulsions.</p>

<p>Next to him was a man who had been hit
in the shoulder by a piece of a shell. The
bone was smashed to pieces, and several days
after the battle I took a piece of iron as large
as a hen's egg from a great hole near the
man's armpit. I asked him to let me amputate
the arm at the shoulder joint; but he would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
let it be done, and he was still alive some weeks
afterwards when I finally left Plevna. The
fourth man had been shot in the thigh, and
the wound had no chance of healing without
proper dressing. I used to squeeze out about
a pint of matter from it every day. The fifth
patient had been shot in the clavicle, and had
a huge ragged wound in the shoulder. I used
to stuff it with cotton-wool, and try to keep
the maggots from collecting in the cavity; but
when I took out the plug of wool, there were
always maggots underneath it. Four out of the
five were dead before I left the town.</p>

<p>In the large room, which contained sixty men,
though the space would not properly accommodate
more than twenty, I had several cases of
blood-poisoning due to the colours "running" in
the cheap prints which I was obliged to use for
bandages. The dyes got into the wounds, and
pyæmia carried off the men like rotting sheep.
The food up to this period was still fairly good,
and we had plenty of good water.</p>

</h2>

<p>One very peculiar case came under my notice
in the principal ward. It was that of a man
who had been struck by a spent bullet over the
region of the liver. The wound had not penetrated
the flesh, and there was nothing but a
small, sloughing sore over the liver to indicate
the spot where the man had been hit. Two days
afterwards he developed acute jaundice, and died
in three days. I could not understand it at the
time, but it struck me afterwards that the blow
from the bullet had ruptured the liver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>To add to the horrors of the general situation,
confluent small-pox made its appearance among
the wounded; and as I had no means of isolating
the patients, it quickly spread. Then several
cases of typhoid fever broke out, owing to the
insanitary conditions; but strangely enough the
disease did not spread, and the mortality from
it was small. Imagine the miseries of an unhappy
man, who, while suffering from a smashed
thigh which prevented him from even moving
to resist the maggots that assailed him, was then
smitten with small-pox or typhoid fever!</p>

<p>Little by little the septic troubles increased,
and at last the crown of misery was reached when
hospital gangrene made its appearance. Few
civilian medical men now practising have ever
seen hospital gangrene; but the records of the
terrible mischief which it produced in the days
before the discovery of the antiseptic treatment
are still extant. The patients who took the
hospital gangrene usually suffered considerably,
while they rotted away before my eyes, and I
was powerless to help them.</p>

<p>The men also got covered with body lice; and
as I spent fourteen hours a day as a rule lifting
them up, washing them, and dressing their wounds,
the noxious insects attacked me too, and during
the whole of my subsequent stay in Plevna I was
never absolutely free from them. I had only two
flannel shirts, and one of these was boiled every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
day by my servant; but in spite of all precautions,
I could never keep free from the insect pests.</p>

<p>Every morning when I went to the hospital
the first thing that met my eyes as I opened the
little wicket-gate leading into the garden was the
row of corpses of the men who had died during
the previous night. They were put out there to
wait for the burial parties, and the sight never
failed to make a profound impression on me. As
I walked past them up the path the sight of
those dead faces fascinated me; and when I found
among them men who were my special favourites,
and who had told me the stories of their simple,
uneventful lives, and of their wives and children
waiting for them in distant parts of the Turkish
Empire, a feeling of overpowering depression
came over me. I was so utterly helpless to save
them, and I was fighting such a hopeless battle,
that once or twice I sat down in the hospital and
cried like a child. As fast as the men died fresh
ones were brought in, and often I found that
twenty old faces had gone during the night and
that the same number of new ones awaited me
in the morning. Skirmishes were always going
on between the outposts, and the intermittent
bombardment claimed a daily quota of victims,
a considerable proportion of whom were sent
to me for treatment.</p>

<p>It was at this period that I was wounded for
the first and last time out of all the scores of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
occasions that I have been under fire. It was
a mere flesh wound, little more indeed than a
scratch; but as I was in a very low state of health
from continuous overwork and under-feeding, the
flesh wound set up a local condition which still
further reduced my strength, and contributed
eventually to my leaving Plevna for a short rest.
As I was unable to get back again, owing to the
Russians closing the road, I was prevented from
witnessing the last pathetic scene of all, when
Osman Pasha's heroic defence was exhausted,
and he had to surrender to the invader.</p>

<p>A chance shot from a Russian field-gun did it
for me, during the desultory firing that went on
languidly from day to day between the opposing
redoubts. I was riding out one morning to visit
Sadik Pasha, and was cantering leisurely across
to the Bash Tabiya, when I heard the scream of
a shell, and recognized instinctively that it was
coming my way. One got so used to estimating
the course of shells from constant practice that one
could pretty well tell by the sound where a particular
shell was likely to fall. My charger too
was a perfect old war-hardened veteran, and he
took no more notice of a shell exploding five yards
in front of his nose than if it had been a custard-apple.
When I heard the whistle of the shell, I
stuck the spurs in and tried to get out of the
way in time; but I did not succeed, and when it
exploded a bit of the casing took me in the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of the neck with a sharp, burning shock that felt
as if I had been struck with a piece of red-hot
iron. When I put my hand up to the place, I
drew it back covered with blood; but I quickly
discovered that it was a mere surface wound,
and when I got back to town and bandaged it, I
found that it did not in the least interfere with
the performance of my medical duties. However,
an abscess formed on the place, and troubled me
a good deal.</p>

<p>I was very much overworked. Neither food
nor rest was plentiful. I never saw a compatriot,
and I spent all my waking hours in the
midst of horrible sufferings which I was powerless
to alleviate. It was no wonder, under these
circumstances, that I became despondent; and
after this lapse of time I may as well confess that
the thought occurred to me whether it would
not be better to blow my brains out than go on
in the misery any longer. But when I looked
round on those magnificent men&mdash;more long-suffering,
patient, and courageous men I have
never seen in my life&mdash;I banished the dark
thought, and went back to the work with all the
spirit I could muster. Sometimes even now
when I lie awake at night I see myself again
dressed in a blood-stained shirt and pair of
trousers, as I picked my way among the huddled
forms with their ashen faces bound up in those
fantastic bandages of coloured print. I see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
pools of curdled blood on the floor, the staring
whitewashed walls, and the little squares of blue
sky through the latticed windows. I hear the
stifled moans and I catch the delirious murmurs
of that Anatolian Turk as in his death-throes,
like Falstaff "he babbled o' green fields."</p>

<p>Although we had no female nurses, still I found
that the Turkish women, whenever they had an
opportunity, attended to the wounded with the
devotion of a Florence Nightingale. There was
a small outbuilding in the grounds that surrounded
the hospital, and this also was filled with
wounded. One day I found two Turkish women
there, and learned that they were frequent visitors,
bringing milk and broth to the wounded. When
I saw them, they were moving silently about in
their long white robes, with only the eyes showing
through their thick yashmaks. One exceptionally
hideous case in the outbuilding received attention
from them. The man had been struck on the
side of the face by a shell, which carried away
the whole of his upper and lower jaws. Only
his eyes remained, looking plaintively out above
the mangled mass that had once been a human
face. The Turkish women could just see by the
roots of the tongue the position of the gullet,
and they kept the unfortunate wretch alive for
four days by pouring milk down his throat.</p>

<p>One evening, as I was leaving the hospital
almost heart-broken, three men were brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in, and I went back to attend to them. One
man had both his legs taken off by a shell from
a heavy siege-gun, and was blanched from loss
of blood; the second had been struck by a shell,
which had carried away arm and shoulder together;
the third was shot through the lungs by
a rifle-bullet. Next morning, when I returned to
the hospital, I saw the three men lying out dead
on the path as soon as I opened the gate. Some
idea of the hopelessness of my position may be
gathered by the medical reader, when he learns
that I had forty-seven compound comminuted
fractures under my hands at one time, and all
were suppurating, while I had no appliances of
any kind for dressing them properly.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs when Chefket
Pasha opened up the road from Sofia again with
a relief column bringing up under his escort a
supply of medical stores and a party of English
doctors who desired to volunteer their services.
The head of the medical party was Dr. Bond
Moore; and very picturesque he looked when he
arrived in his Circassian dress. With him was
Dr. Mackellar, who had gained a reputation in
the Franco-Prussian war, and was a well known
authority on gunshot wounds. Then there was
Mr. David Christie Murray, who was at that time
a war correspondent, but was introduced to me
as a medical student, and in that capacity had
an opportunity of inspecting my hospital, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
he afterwards described very graphically in the
<i>Scotsman</i>. A man named Smith, who was in
the Indian Civil Service, and who had come up
for the sake of the adventure, was another
member of the party, which also included my old
friend George Stoker, now a Harley Street
physician. Last, but not least, there was Captain
Morisot, a charming fellow, who was afterwards
with me at Erzeroum.</p>

<p>The visitors hunted me up when they arrived,
and we had a great supper at my quarters. It
was an intense relief to meet some of my own
countrymen at last, and I was so glad to see
them that I distributed all my curios among
them, presenting to these strangers the crosses
in bronze and gold, the lockets, and the other
trinkets that had belonged to Russian owners
before they were sold in the Plevna bazaars as
grim treasure-trove of the battle-field.</p>

<p>Dr. Mackellar was an old friend, for I had
met him before the war when I was in Vienna;
and I was delighted also to meet George Stoker,
who was one of my fellow passengers when I
came down the Danube. It is difficult for any
one who has never been placed in such a position
to form an idea of the delightful sensation which
I experienced at meeting with English-speaking
men again after a period of seventeen months
spent out of the hearing of my mother tongue.
Imagine the feelings of an Englishman when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
first catches sight of the white cliffs of Dover
after long travelling in foreign lands; or think of
the sensations of an Australian returning after
a couple of years in Europe when he sees the
lights at Port Phillip Heads or the entrance to
Sydney Harbour again. My feelings were similar
when I dropped my Turkish and picked up my
half-forgotten English once more in the presence
of men of my own race, whose cheerful talk
dispelled the gloomy thoughts which my daily
struggle against the ever increasing forces of
suffering and disease had engendered.</p>

<p>The wound on the back of my neck was very
painful, and the large abscess which had formed
on it had still further reduced my system. Dr.
Mackellar lanced it for me the first night he was
in Plevna, and this gave me great relief.</p>

<p>George Stoker had a bad attack of dysentery
when he arrived, and he arranged to stop at my
place so that I could look after him more easily.
I opened up negotiations with my little fair-haired
Bulgarian boy, who managed, with a good deal of
trouble, to get me some milk, and thus I was
enabled to provide proper diet for the invalid.</p>

<p>On the morning after the arrival of the English
medical party, Dr. Bond Moore, with Mr. Harvey,
a man of English parentage, who was born in
the Levant and spoke Turkish like a Turk,
together with Dr. Mackellar, waited upon Osman
Pasha in his tent. Dr. Bond Moore explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
to Osman Pasha through Mr. Harvey that they
had been sent out by the Stafford House Committee,
a large national organization in London
which had collected £50,000 for the purpose of
relieving the sufferings caused by the war in
Turkey. They desired to undertake the care of
the wounded Turks then in Plevna.</p>

<p>Now Osman Pasha was essentially a man of
action. Though there was plenty of the <i>fortiter
in re</i> about him, there was little of the <i>suaviter
in modo</i>; and Bond Moore and Mackellar, who
did not know him as well as I did, jumped to the
conclusion that he was intentionally discourteous
in his reception of them and in his reply to their
representations. He pointed out to them that
of the four thousand wounded men who were
then in the hospitals, more than two-thirds would
be sent away to Sofia on the following day, now
that the road had been opened up by Chefket
Pasha. This determination on his part, he
explained, was dictated by consideration for the
wounded as well as for the rest of the troops in
Plevna. They would receive better treatment
at Sofia, they would leave more rations for the
fighting men, and there would again be room in
the hospitals available for the wounded men who
might be expected after future engagements.
Probably, continued Osman, not more than four
hundred wounded men would be left in the
hospitals when the ambulance train went away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and meanwhile the medical staff at his disposal
was quite strong enough to cope with the work.
He also had another powerful reason for sending
away the wounded in the overcrowding of the
hospitals, which was causing terrible devastation
by septic disease; and we knew that if the congested
wards were relieved, we might get the
upper hand of the gangrene and pyæmia which
were doing all the damage.</p>

<p>Naturally enough Bond Moore and Mackellar
were staggered to find that, after travelling all
the way from England and incurring a good
many hardships on the way, they were not to
be allowed to do the work for which they had
been sent. They represented to Osman Pasha
the danger of sending away on a long and terrible
journey wounded men who were quite unfit to
travel; and Bond Moore, as the spokesman,
entered a vigorous protest against the "gross
inhumanity" of the course proposed by the
Turkish commander-in-chief. Osman Pasha,
however, was inexorable; and always a brusque
and stern man at the best, he became still more
forbidding in his manner when the English
doctors reiterated their protests. The deputation
left the tent in high dudgeon at what they
regarded as the discourtesy of their reception,
and were thoroughly disappointed after reaching
Plevna in safety to be peremptorily ordered to
quit it at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>As a further protest, Dr. Mackellar waited
upon Hassib Bey, our principal medical officer,
and I was present at the interview, in which the
English surgeon told the old Turk that it was
a disgrace to humanity to send the wounded
away by carts in the condition in which they
were. The conversation was carried on in
French, and Dr. Mackellar spoke very strongly,
declaring that it was a barbarous and brutal
thing to send the wounded men away, many
of whom he considered, as a surgeon of large
experience, to be quite unfit to travel. I felt
quite sorry for poor old Hassib Bey, especially
as I myself, with a full comprehension of the
whole position, was thoroughly in accord with
Osman Pasha's view. It was perfectly plain to
me that the wisest course was to despatch the
wounded men from out the crowded hospitals
into the fresh air and away to Sofia. No doubt
a percentage of them would die on the road
from the actual hardship of travel; but if they
were left in Plevna, a far larger proportion would
inevitably die of septic diseases, while the congested
condition of the hospitals would be still
further aggravated, and slow starvation would
add shortly to the sufferings of the unfortunates.
The proof of the wisdom of Osman Pasha's
action was very manifest afterwards; for though
he was starved out eventually, he could not have
held the town nearly as long as he did if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
not seized the opportunity when the road was
open to send the wounded away.</p>

<p>Hassib Bey listened deprecatingly to Dr.
Mackellar's spirited protest; but the fiat had
gone forth from headquarters, and he was
powerless to accede to his visitor's request even
if he had the inclination.</p>

<p>Dr. Bond Moore sent in a formal written protest
to Osman Pasha, who vouchsafed no reply,
and the Stafford House surgeons spent the rest
of the day examining my hospital. In connection
with this incident of the expulsion of the Stafford
House doctors from Plevna, I may reproduce
the report on the subject, which I afterwards
sent to Mr. V. B. Kennett, the Stafford House
commissioner. My report, which was published in
the <i>Times</i> of November 15, 1877, ran as follows:</p>

<p>"At your request I write to you a short
account of the state of Plevna on the occasion
of the visit of Dr. Bond Moore, Stafford House
section, and the circumstances attending the
evacuation of the wounded. When Drs. Bond
Moore and Mackellar arrived in Plevna, we
had in our hospitals there between four and
five thousand wounded, probably three thousand
five hundred of them having received their
wounds between September 5 and October
12, the remainder being the graver cases of
our former fighting which were considered too
serious to send on to Sofia. We have always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
received orders after any heavy fighting to
send off all who were not too gravely wounded
to Sofia, and so we have by this means never
had more than five or six hundred in our
hospitals. But unfortunately, during the hard
fighting in September, we were completely surrounded
by the Russians, and were actually,
so to speak, in a state of siege, so that we had
the accumulation of nearly a month's fighting in
addition to the graver cases of our earlier battles.
Such was the state of affairs when Chefket Pasha
relieved Plevna, and when Drs. Moore and
Mackellar arrived and kindly offered to form
hospitals in Plevna. On presenting themselves
to Osman they were received quite courteously.
He told them he was very glad to see them,
but that if they were sent in the real cause of
humanity, and to assist his wounded, he much
preferred them leaving for Sofia and establishing
themselves there; if, however, they wished
to remain and see the fighting, they were perfectly
welcome to do so, but if they did they would
have very little work to do, as he was sending
nearly all the wounded to Sofia, and for those
who were remaining he had a sufficient staff of
surgeons. His reasons for sending away the
wounded must appear most obvious to any one
knowing the circumstances of the case. I believe
that it is always one of the first considerations
of a general, after a battle, to send off as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
as possible all wounded who are in a state
to travel, in order to make room for further
fighting. In addition to this main consideration,
I must state that our accommodation was very
insufficient, that many of our hospitals consisted
of houses without windows, and we were fearfully
overcrowded, often having thirty men in a room
only large enough for ten. Then, again, we
had no beds, and could not procure them as
there was no wood to make them of. Another
great consideration was that we had not sufficient
nor proper food, having only the bare necessaries
of life, such as biscuits and meat. From a
sanitary point of view, it was also extremely
desirable to remove them as quickly as possible,
thereby lessening the chances of an epidemic,
which is always liable to break out when such
a large population is confined in a small area.
It was, I believe, in 1866 that a very serious
epidemic of cholera broke out in Plevna. Of the
four thousand five hundred wounded I believe
that all but two hundred and fifty were sent off,
the wounds of those remaining being of the very
gravest character. Most of the wounds of those
sent away were very slight, being flesh wounds
caused by bullets, which would be perfectly healed
in from twenty to thirty days. I believe in all
about sixty or seventy cases of fracture were
sent off; in most of them union had already
occurred, and in those in which it had not I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of opinion that they stood a better chance of
recovery by their removal from a hospital impregnated
with septic germs into a purer atmosphere
and where they could have more attention
paid to them. Dr. George Stoker took with him
in his ambulance to Orkhanieh forty cases, but
it must be remembered that these were the very
gravest. Three of them died on the way; but
as they were cases out of my own hospital I can
speak about them with confidence, and can say
that in the most favourable circumstances recovery
would have been impossible. Osman Pasha also
acted with foresight from a military point of
view; for had he not sent off his wounded, and
had Stafford House and the Red Crescent retained
them in hospitals established there, what would
be their position at present now that Plevna is
again surrounded by the Russians? It must be
a matter of satisfaction to Osman Pasha to have
sent off as many of the non-combatant population
as possible, for it must be a great drain on one's
commissariat to have to feed four or five thousand
non-combatants in a place like Plevna where
provisions are so difficult to procure. I may
add that I consider I am in a position to speak
with authority on such a subject, as I have been
for fifteen months in the Turkish service, and for
the last five have been in Plevna."</p>

<p>When the medical men went round my hospital,
they saw the horrors among which I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
working for the previous month, and then I took
them out to our operating theatre under the blue
sky on the banks of the Tutchenitza. Here
Dr. Mackellar performed several operations, and
showed us some brilliant surgery, including four
disarticulations of the shoulder joint.</p>

<p>Next day we all rode out to the Krishin
redoubt which Skobeleff had taken, and which
was soon afterwards recaptured with fearful loss.
I was able to point out the exact spot where
the heaviest of the fighting had taken place to
Dr. Bond Moore, Dr. Mackellar, and Mr. David
Christie Murray, who were naturally interested
in making a personal inspection of the scene of
such a great historical fight.</p>

<p>As the four of us rode away in a southerly
direction to the Ibrahim Bey redoubt, the Russian
artillerymen saw us, and in a couple of seconds
the Stafford House doctors and the war correspondent
had an experience which struck them
with all the force of the novel and the unexpected.
The Russians fired six shells at us, and it certainly
was a wonder that some of us were not
killed, for the artillerymen had found the range
by long practice at the redoubts, and their shells
fell all round us. It was no novelty for me to
hear the projectiles whizzing about, but I was
surprised at the courage and coolness with which
the visitors behaved, and luckily all four of us
came out of it without a scratch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening I thought the whole position
over, and determined to apply for a short leave of
absence, and take a trip down to Constantinople
with the intention of returning to Plevna in a
couple of weeks. I should not have dreamed of
leaving the position so long as I could be of any
real service there; but most of the wounded men
were about to be sent away, and there would be
nothing left for me to do. In addition to this, I
was in a very bad state of health. I had a large
suppurating cavity at the back of my neck from
my wound, and my system had completely run
down. My mother, whom I had not seen for years,
was then in Europe, and I thought that it would
be a capital opportunity to run down and see
her. Moreover, my agreement with the Turkish
Government was for only one year, and I had
already been serving for seventeen months. It
was these considerations, and not, as was afterwards
stated in various newspapers, the refusal of
Osman Pasha to avail himself of the assistance
of the Stafford House doctors, that induced me
to interview Hassib Bey and apply for leave of
absence. I asked him for leave of absence for
two or three weeks, pointing out that nearly all
the wounded would be sent away, and that there
was no immediate likelihood of any more fighting
before I returned. Hassib Bey said that he would
give me leave with very great pleasure, and he
voluntarily gave me a letter to the Seraskierat, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
which he was good enough to express the very
highest appreciation of my services. In fact,
it was practically impossible for any man to get
a higher testimonial than that which Hassib Bey
gave me on the eve of my departure from Plevna.
He suggested that I should ask Osman Pasha
to ratify the leave of absence; and Tewfik Pasha
having conducted me into Osman Pasha's presence,
I repeated my application to him, assuring
him that I would not think of leaving as long as
there was any work for me to do. The Muchir
thanked me for my services, of which he expressed
high appreciation, and hoped to see me back in
Plevna.</p>

<p>If I could have foreseen that the road would be
blocked again by the Russians, and that it would be
impossible for me to return once I left the town, I
would have stayed by the troops at all costs. I
was devoted to the Turkish army and the Turkish
cause. I never spared myself in carrying out
my duties, and I was bound by the strongest ties
of attachment to my patients, as they were also,
I felt and knew, to me. I positively loved the
great, rough barbarians who bore their sufferings
with such noble fortitude in my hospital, and
during the whole of my time in Plevna I never
had the slightest unpleasantness with a single
one of them, and received always the greatest
gratitude from them all. At that time there was
no Turk in Plevna more Turkish in sympathies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
than I was. I threw my whole heart and soul
and all my energies into the Turkish cause, and
no one could have gone through all that I had
without being impressed with a feeling of the
most profound admiration for the patience,
courage, and heroic patriotism of the Turkish
private soldier. Intending as I did to remain
away for a couple of weeks at most, I felt that
the parting was only temporary; and when I
went to say good-bye to the colonel of my
regiment, Suleiman Bey, he wished me a cheery
<i>au revoir</i>, expecting to see me soon back again.
I had quite an affecting farewell with dear old
Hassib Bey, and I also went round and said
good-bye to all my intimate friends and the men
with whom I had been brought most closely
into contact. It was a great disappointment to
me that I could not find the regimental barber,
a little red-headed Turk, who used to shave
me every Sunday, whether there was firing in
progress or not, making me sit down on the
ground and taking my head between his knees
for the better performance of his task. Anxious
as I was to make him a little present in recognition
of his skill and punctuality, I was unable to
find him. Like his brethren of the craft in other
countries, he was a most loquacious conversationalist,
and I got all the gossip of the trenches
during the ten minutes that I was under his
hands every Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>My Circassian servant Ahmet had to go back
to the ranks, much to his disgust, when I went
away, and from that time forward his lot was by
no means such a happy one as before. Instead
of leisurely cooking my pilaf, grooming my horse,
and occasionally raiding the country for hay,
poultry, eggs, or anything else that he could get for
his own benefit as well as mine, the poor fellow
had to take his place in the wet trenches, with no
bed but a hole scooped in the clay, and little to
expect in the way of breakfast except a bullet.</p>

<p>Dr. Stoker had about twenty smooth-running
ambulance waggons specially built for the conveyance
of wounded men, and having loaded these
up with the most dangerous cases he set out on
the long journey to Sofia. Having no further
use for a horse, I sold mine to Dr. Mackellar,
and took my passage in one of the ambulance
waggons. Then the night before I left Plevna
the other fellows gave us a great send off and
we had a splendid supper at the house of Dr.
Robert, who, I regret to say, became hopelessly
intoxicated, and insisted on yelling patriotic songs
in half a dozen languages, while he thumped his
piano until the yellow-faced Viennese housekeeper
hauled him off in wrath and turned us all out.
Poor Robert! Long before this we had eaten
all his zoological specimens, his tame deer as well
as his poultry; but he forgave us all. I never
saw him again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Mustapha Bey was quite concerned when
I told him that I was going away. I had won
the goodwill of this crusty old colonel of a
regiment of cavalry some weeks before by the
promise of a gift of some real Scotch whisky,
which the old chap had read of but never tasted.
He was an inveterate toper when he got the
chance, being in this respect quite a rarity in the
Ottoman army, and would drink raki or anything
else with a fine, generous disregard of quality as
long as the quantity was there. My friend Mr.
Wrench, who was then the British consul in
Constantinople, and who has lately died, promised
to send me up a case of real Scotch whisky, and
it came up in the previous train of arabas. At
least the case came up all right, but of the dozen
bottles only two remained for the disappointed
consignee&mdash;myself. Of course we had a general
jollification, and the last drop of genuine Glenlivet
had vanished down the capacious gullet of an
Austrian medico before I remembered with a
pang of regret my promise to Mustapha Bey.
Fortunately he had never tasted whisky, so there
was still a possibility of keeping faith with him,
at any rate in appearance. I confided my predicament
to my comrades, and we brewed a
special <i>cuvée réservée</i> for the Turk. The basis,
I recollect, consisted of a decoction of prunes
boiled with some of the wine of the country,
which was heavily loaded with kerosene or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
other mineral oil, and brought to the right amber
hue by the addition of a little harmless colouring
matter. This salubrious beverage I filtered
through a sponge, bottled in one of the empty
whisky bottles, and sent to Mustapha Bey with
my compliments. When I next met him, he was
smacking his lips with retrospective gusto, declaring
that he had never tasted anything so
delicious in his life. Poor old fellow! I felt
quite guilty when I went to say good-bye to him,
especially when he added at the last, "Be sure
when you come back to bring me up another
bottle of Scotch whisky."</p>

<p>Next morning I went away in one of the
smoothly running ambulance cars brought up by
Dr. Stoker. I had a pair of horses, and drove
them down to Telish, where we stayed the first
night. It was a mercy that we were able to get
on in front of the long line of about three hundred
arabas, each drawn by two small white oxen and
laden with wounded. The carts creaked along at
about two miles an hour, and as we passed them
the groans and cries which the excruciating agony
forced from the unfortunate sufferers were most
painful to hear. Some of the men had fractures
which remained unset, and the torture produced
by the broken ends of bone jarring together as
the waggon jolted and bumped over the rough
road can be left to the imagination. Most of the
men, however, bore their dreadful sufferings with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
a grim silence that was as painful as the cries.
Oh that ghastly journey of wounded men to
Sofia! And here and there a cart would stop
while the driver lifted out a dead man from
among his still living fellow travellers, and laid
him down by the side of the road, at rest at last
from the fearful jolting of the araba. There was
no time to dig a grave, so the body was left
there to soak in the rain and bleach in the sun,
along the white road that wound from Plevna
to Orkhanieh. I have no means of knowing
accurately what proportion of the wounded died
on the road, but I should estimate it at about
7 per cent. Had they been left behind at Plevna,
probably at least 50 per cent, would have been
swept away by septic disease and slow starvation.</p>

<p>At Telish, where we spent the first night, I
found Hakki Pasha in command, and was very
kindly treated by him. This was the scene of
a severe fight about a fortnight after we passed
through.</p>

<p>After three days' travelling we reached Orkhanieh,
our first stopping-place of any considerable
size; and here a number of the wounded who
could go no farther were placed in the hospital.
At Orkhanieh the hospital arrangements were a
welcome change from those at Plevna. I met
a man named Temple Bey there, an Englishman,
who had been in the Turkish service for a great
number of years. There were several English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
surgeons, and suitable houses had been turned
into hospitals. I met a man named Roy, and
another named Gill, now a well known practitioner
at Welshpool; a man named Pinkerton, working
at the hospitals in Orkhanieh; and there I said
good-bye to my friend Dr. Mackellar, who
remained behind to perform some operations, and
stayed there for a considerable time. When I
was leaving him, he kindly gave me a letter to
Baron Munday, an Austrian doctor, who was
an enthusiast in the cause of philanthropy, and
who afterwards showed me great kindness in
Constantinople.</p>

<p>At Sofia I met Lady Strangford, who had a
well equipped hospital, worked by three or four
English doctors and several English nurses.
There were fifty or sixty beds in it, and the
contrast between this hospital and the dreadful
place that I had left behind at Plevna was as
startling as the difference between an "Inferno"
and a "Paradiso." Lady Strangford gave me
a letter to the Baroness von Rosen, who had
another hospital at Adrianople, and I spent a
couple of pleasant days with that enthusiastic
lady. Going on to Ichtiman, I met there Fano
Bey, who was the second military officer in charge
of the hospitals at Widdin; and as he arrived late
at night, I was glad of the opportunity of repaying
some of his past kindnesses by giving up my
room to him. Next day we went on to Tatar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Bazardjik, which was the terminus of the railway
from Constantinople; and there, in the company
of half a dozen jolly war correspondents, I shook
off the last traces of the depression engendered
by the horrors of my hospital work in Plevna.</p>

<p>In Constantinople I put up again at Misserie's
Hotel. During the fifteen months that had
elapsed since I last saw that comfortable hostelry
I had lived a whole lifetime, and coming back
to it again, a war-worn veteran of twenty-three,
the French cooking and the soft beds after many
a dinner of raw maize cobs and many a sleep on
the bare earth appealed to my feelings in the
most convincing manner possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time the eyes of the world were turned
towards Plevna, and I found, somewhat to my
astonishment, that my name was already fairly
well known in Stamboul. Every one was anxious
to hear something of the famous victories that
had just been won from an eye-witness, and I
had to fight my battles over again in the club
and the café, the bureau and the boudoir, for
the benefit of hundreds of patriotic inquirers
all eager for the latest news. Among others I
met General Sir Collingwood Dickson, an old
Crimea man, who was intensely interested in the
operations against the enemy, whose grey coats he
had seen in front of him some three and twenty
years before at Alma and at Inkermann. It was
wonderful to see the warrior's eyes flashing with
the battle-light again, as I told him the story of
the Krishin redoubts&mdash;how Skobeleff took them
and held them for one desperate day and night,
and how, after many repulses, the Ottoman troops
at five o'clock on the following afternoon poured
over the parapets in a mighty, irresistible wave
and swept the Russians back to the Green Hills
once more.</p>

<p>Taking Osman Pasha's letter with me, I paid
a visit to the Seraskierat, and, having presented
my introduction, was welcomed most warmly by
the officers of the War Office, who thanked me
on behalf of the Turkish Government for my
services. Up to this time the Ottoman troops had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
been making a very good fight of it on the whole,
in spite of the losses at the Shipka Pass and on
the Lom; and the brilliant victories which Osman
Pasha had been winning encouraged the officers
of the Seraskierat to hope for further successes.
It is perhaps outside my purpose here to criticise
in detail the conduct of the operations by the
Turkish Government; but I cannot help referring
to the opinion which was very generally expressed
outside that the mismanagement and divided
control at headquarters were entirely responsible
for the headway which the enemy had made up
to the present, and that if the brilliant qualities
of the Turkish forces in the field had been
supported by a more rational and consistent
policy at Constantinople the peaked caps of the
Russians would never have been seen before
Stamboul.</p>

<p>My mother, whom I was very anxious to see,
was in England at this time, and I had written
to her upon my arrival in Constantinople. While
I waited to get a reply from her, I had plenty
of time to look about me and see the change
which had taken place in the daily life of the
Turkish capital since my previous visit. Upon
the outbreak of a war the adventurers of all
nations seem to emerge from their hiding-places,
and flock to the scene of action for the profit, the
pleasure, or the excitement that they can pick
up. The carcase, in fact, was there, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
could see the eagles gathering together from
every quarter. I met a good many Englishmen
of the roving, dare-devil class that has done so
much to build up our own empire, and here in
default of an outlet among Christian nations they
were trying all they knew to get into the Turkish
army. Many of them had a special axe to grind
of some sort. They had inventions, new weapons,
or improved clothing, or equipment which they
desired to sell to the Turkish Government. For
instance, there was a man called Harris, who had
a scheme for blowing up the bridge across the
Danube at Sistova with torpedoes, and was very
anxious that I should join him in his absurd
scheme. His idea was to send down the river
a small fleet of torpedoes which would destroy
the bridge as soon as they came into contact with
it. How the destruction of the bridge could
hinder the advance of the Russians or alter the
course of the campaign he loftily declined to
explain, and my stupidity was such that I missed
this unique opportunity of securing fame and
fortune at a blow. Another man whom I met
belonged to a species which is fairly well distributed&mdash;more's
the pity&mdash;over the outlying
portions especially of the British Empire. He
was gentlemanly, well dressed, and by no means
presuming. He talked well, and evidently knew
the world. One would take him to be about
thirty-five years of age, though the lines in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
forehead and round the mouth and the streaks
of grey in his hair showed that he had lived all
the time. He took a tremendous interest in the
fighting round Plevna, and he invited me to
dinner with him one evening. Let us call him
Smith, although that was not his name. Well, I
had a very excellent dinner; and when it was
over I had to pay for it myself, as also for Mr.
Smith's own well selected repast and bottle of
Château Léoville. Over the cigars afterwards
he casually asked me to lend him five pounds;
but I found, to my regret, that I had not got the
money on me.</p>

<p>If there were plenty of adventurers in Constantinople
just then, there were also plenty of sterling,
good fellows always ready to do one a good turn
without any ulterior object. I made a delightful
acquaintance, for instance, when I met Charles
Austin, a Fellow of St. John's, Oxford, who had
gone out to Constantinople to act as special correspondent
for the <i>Times</i>. Another capital fellow
was Frank Ives Scudamore, whom every one in
Constantinople knew. He was the head of the
British post-office there; and when I told him
that I had spent twenty pounds of my own money
in telegraphing to the <i>Standard</i> from Widdin
when their own correspondent went away, Scudamore
paid me the money out of his own pocket,
telling me that he would get it from the paper.
His son was acting as the correspondent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
some London paper too, and I saw a good deal
of him. The names of the Englishmen whom I
met in the town at that exciting time would fill
many pages; but I can mention a few of them.
There was Colonel Valentine Baker, for instance
(Baker Pasha), who was accounted one of the
finest cavalry officers in Europe, and was engaged
in reorganizing the <i>gendarmerie</i>. He had picked
out a lot of retired English officers for positions,
and among them I met Colonel Swire, Colonel
Norton, Colonel Alix, and a fire-eating, devil-may-care
Irishman named Briscoe, who had been
in the Guards, and who was the life and soul of
the club. An exceptionally interesting old chap
was General Berdan, the inventor of the Russian
rifle that bore his name. I looked at the harmless,
gentle old chap with considerable awe when
I recollected the awful scenes in my hospital and
the deadly evidences of the hard-hitting Berdan
bullets. There were several fellows who had
failed in examinations at Sandhurst or Woolwich,
and were now hunting for glory where they fancied
that a good seat on horseback would be more
serviceable than trigonometry and a fair shot
with the revolver would be more valuable than
the most intimate acquaintance with the differential
calculus. A Sir Peter Something-or-other,
who was trying to sell uniforms to the Turkish
Government, completes the list of my personal
club acquaintances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>During the few days that I was at Constantinople,
Valentine Baker organized a delightful
picnic to the Gulf of Ismet, where the British fleet
were lying, and he invited me to join the party.
We went up the Gulf of Ismet in a small steamer,
and at Prinkapo we took on board an addition
to our party including several ladies.</p>

<p>After a few hours' steaming, we came in sight
of the ships of the British squadron riding at
anchor on the blue waters of the gulf; and fighting
though I had been under the Turkish flag, I felt
a thrill of pride as our little launch passed under
the stern of the mighty <i>Téméraire</i> and I saw
the dear old ensign flying over me again. Those
were stirring times in international politics, for
word had been passed round in high diplomatic
circles as well as on the stages of the London
music-halls that "the Russians shall not have
Constantinople," and the presence of the <i>Achilles</i>,
the <i>Alexandra</i>, the <i>Téméraire</i>, and the other
ships of Admiral Hornby's squadron almost within
shell fire of Stamboul showed that Great Britain
had made up her mind definitely upon this point.</p>

<p>We lunched with Commodore Hewitt on
board the <i>Achilles</i>, and after lunch we had plenty
of time to examine the equipment of that splendid
fighting machine. As I watched the ladies in
their white dresses tripping along the snowy
decks and peering down the sights of the great,
silent, burnished guns that pointed out towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Stamboul, I thought of those other guns that I
had left behind at Plevna, grim, powder-blackened,
blood-bespattered veterans, that continued their
deadly work until, broken and dismounted, with
their gun crews lying round them, they were
silenced at last in the Krishin redoubts.</p>

<p>We had a delightful day with the squadron,
and in the evening we steamed back to the city
of many minarets, upon which the eyes of Europe
were day by day directed. At Prinkapo I met
a man called Pearse, a brother Australian. He
was the first graduate in law from the Adelaide
University. He had a big practice at the bar
in the English court at Constantinople, and we
had much to tell each other of our adventures
since we crossed the line.</p>

<p>My friend Mr. Wrench, the British consul at
Constantinople, was extremely kind to me, and I
ventured to approach him upon a somewhat
delicate question. Much as I admired the
character of the Turkish troops and their soldierly
qualities in the field, I could not be blind to one
conspicuous defect in Turkish official nature. It
was plain from the first that the executive had
a rooted dislike to paying over a single piastre
to any one for services rendered. The pay of
the troops was months in arrear, and my own
little bill was mounting up to a quite portentous
figure. Perhaps it occurred to the paymaster of
the forces that it would be folly to hand over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
good money to a man who might have his pockets
carried away together with his legs by a convenient
shell at any moment. At any rate the
fact remained that I was owed about £70 by the
Turkish Government at this time; and as I
had no hopes of recovering my medical fees by
my own unaided efforts, I laid the matter before
Mr. Wrench.</p>

<p>Mr. Wrench had lived long in Constantinople,
and was intimately acquainted with all the devious
approaches to the ear of officialdom. I do not
know how many cups of coffee he was obliged to
drink, nor how many artfully worded compliments
he paid to solemn old pashas sitting cross-legged
on their divans; but I do know that in a remarkably
short time, considering the length and
tortuosity of the negotiations which he must have
gone through, he was able to announce to me
that the arrears of my salary of £200 a year
would be paid on application. When I put in my
claim for £70, they brought me the whole amount
in silver coin, and I had to get a small hand-cart
to remove my money, which consisted of
about half a hundredweight of Turkish medjidies.
It was certainly the heaviest fee that I have
ever received for professional services.</p>

<p>In order to be more in the swim, so that I
could hear prompt news of all that was going on
at the seat of war, I left Misserie's Hotel, and took
up my quarters at the club in the Grande Rue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
de Pera. This was a very comfortable and very
cosmopolitan caravanserai, and the members included
the leading section of the foreign element
in Constantinople. Here I met again many of
my old acquaintances, among them being the
Hon. Randolph Stewart, the Queen's Messenger,
who had come down the Danube with me when
I first entered Turkish territory. I found plenty
of congenial spirits in the club, and devoted a
day or two to well deserved relaxation, which
was readily obtainable in Constantinople. In
the evenings we used to go the round of the
<i>cafés chantants</i>, and always found lots of fun
there. One night a French girl came forward
on the stage, and sang a song about Plevna,
which was rapturously applauded. While the
song was going on somebody spotted me in the
audience, and I was accorded a demonstration
which, although it was highly flattering, was
nevertheless decidedly embarrassing.</p>

<p>While I was amusing myself with these frivolities,
the most momentous events were occurring
at the theatre of war. In Asiatic Turkey the
Russians were making rapid headway, and I
learned from Mr. Barrington Kennett, the head
of the Stafford House Relief Committee, who was
then in Constantinople, that the condition of the
Turkish garrison of Erzeroum was deplorable.
Medical aid was urgently required there, and
Mr. Barrington Kennett offered me an engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
at once to take charge of the ambulance
work at Erzeroum for the Stafford House Committee.
I was offered far better terms than I
was getting from the Turks, and a free hand
to do what I liked at Erzeroum; but I determined
not to desert my old friends at Plevna,
and made up my mind to get back there as
soon as I had seen my mother. Mr. Barrington
Kennett asked me to reserve my final decision,
and when I left him the offer was still open.</p>

<p>On the very same day something occurred
which compelled me to change my plans. Sir
Collingwood Dickson sent me a telegram asking
me to call upon him at once in the summer
residence of the British Embassy at Therapia,
and in an interview which I had with him there
he told me that news had just been received
of terrible fighting at Gorny Dübnik and Telish.
The Russian Guards had been brought up, and
after a desperate battle at Telish in which the
Russians lost four thousand men the Turkish
forces sustained a complete defeat. As a result
of this victory the Russians were in possession of
all the approaches to Plevna, and communication
with Osman Pasha's army was absolutely cut off.
I listened to this news with dismay, for it was
clear now that I could not get back to Plevna;
and that night as I lay in bed at the club I made
up my mind to accept the offer of the Stafford
House Committee and go to Erzeroum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Before I was up in the morning Mr. Barrington
Kennett came into my room and told me that
he had received a telegram from Erzeroum giving
the news of a sanguinary battle close to that place.
Mukhtar Pasha had suffered a terrible defeat, and
the condition in Erzeroum was desperate. The
town was full of wounded men, and supplies of
all kinds were urgently needed. Mr. Kennett
asked me to start that day at twelve o'clock as
there was a steamer going, and he offered to give
me any one I liked to go with me, suggesting
that I should take a dragoman and Captain
Morisot, whom I had already met at Plevna,
as a companion. Mr. Stoney, who also belonged
to the Stafford House Committee, and who had
treated me with the greatest kindness, also urged
me to accept the offer; and the upshot of it all
was that I told Mr. Kennett that I would be
ready to start by the steamer at twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>Steamers, however, suffer from unpunctuality
in Turkey as well as elsewhere, and at the last
moment we found that the boat would not start
until next morning. Baron Munday heard of
this, and gave a grand farewell dinner to me at
the club that night, when about a dozen of us sat
down to a regular banquet, and drank each other's
healths in bumpers of champagne. In those old
fighting days a farewell dinner to any one was a
thing to wonder at; for it was always a shade of
odds that a fever or a rifle-bullet would claim a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
good many of the guests before they could meet
again, and the more risky the prospects of the
future the more lively was the certain pleasure
of the present. Late that night, or rather early
next morning, they saw me down to the quay
where the Messageries boat was lying, and I went
on board, lugging with me a bag containing three
hundred English sovereigns&mdash;perhaps the only
coins on earth that will fetch their face value
anywhere. With me there went Dr. Woods, an
adventurous spark from the north of Ireland,
who was deputed to act with me, Captain Morisot,
and Mr. Harvey.</p>

<p>A fine old Frenchman commanded the little
Messageries steamer, and by his manner and
language he seemed a regular old aristocrat, who
had not always been running a small "tramp"
boat on the Black Sea. Although far from Paris,
he had not forgotten the principles of gastronomy,
and the cuisine on board that perambulating little
tub was simply perfect. I had never lived so
well in my life. We had a delightful passage up
the Black Sea, calling in at the different ports
on the north side, Sinope, Samsoun, and finally
Trebizond, where we disembarked for the overland
journey to Erzeroum.</p>

<p>Trebizond is a beautiful town built on a table-land
at the top of high cliffs looking down over
the Black Sea. There was a very good Greek
hotel there, and we put up for the night in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
As soon as possible we called on Mr. Biliotti,<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
the English consul at Trebizond, and he gave
us a message to push on to Erzeroum as quickly
as possible, as Mukhtar Pasha was in urgent
need of medical officers and stores.</p>

<p>With Mr. Biliotti we met Captain McCalmont,
who was on the staff of Sir Arnold Kemball, the
British military attaché in Asiatic Turkey. All
the preliminaries for our journey had been settled
by the indefatigable Mr. Biliotti; and as we had
two dragomen, I left one of them, a man named
Williams, behind us to bring on the heavy
packages, the bandages, drugs, stimulants, and
other medical stores, while we pushed forward
with the other.</p>

<p>When we left Trebizond, our party consisted
of Dr. Woods, Captain Morisot, Harvey, and
myself. We started early in the morning for our
long ride to Erzeroum through the wild and
picturesque country which ethnologists and philologists
have alike decided upon as the cradle of
the human race, and where biblical legend, agreeing
with the conclusions of science, has placed the
primitive Garden of Eden. The road that we
travelled was a splendid one, macadamized nearly
all the way, and built in that solid and enduring
form that men gave to their highways before the
railways came to compete with them. It was
this road that Xenophon travelled with his legions
over two thousand years ago when they made
their famous return march to Greece. Readers
of that dead-and-gone Greek captain's diary will
remember his explicit description of the journey,
and his continually recurring remark that they
came after a stage of so many "parasangs" to
"a populous town, well watered, and situated on
a river." Since Xenophon's day most of those
populous towns have disappeared, and nothing is
left but the beetling cliffs that frowned down
upon the homeward marching Greeks, and the
sea that ripples as fresh and blue to-day as when
the hoplites and the bowmen saw it gleaming at
last before them and ran forward with the glad,
exulting cry, "Thalassa, Thalassa!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>The road is still divided into posts or stages,
and we travelled from stage to stage with fresh
post-horses. It was tiring work riding these
rough and badly broken brutes, and Dr. Woods,
who was an indifferent horseman, suffered very
severely; but the excitement of the journey and
the wildness of the scenery kept us up.</p>

<p>Our first day's journey was very picturesque,
for the road wound along the side of a deep
ravine for many miles, and then curled along the
flanks of the hills that rose above us beautifully
clad with hazel trees. We passed through a part
of the district of Lazistan, and were much struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
by the magnificent type of men that we saw
there, tall, straight, muscular fellows, lithe and
hardy as the mountain ash. Perhaps it is true
that this country is the real cradle of the human
race, and that from there the tide of migration
flowed westward over Europe, sending one tributary
stream down into Greece, and another down
into Italy, and passing onwards in ever increasing
volume, until it spread population, not only through
Western Europe, but away, as industrious archæologists
have whispered, conning their strange
finds among the Incas of Peru and Mexico, to
the great Western continent that lay beyond the
fabled inland of Atlantis. At any rate those who
hold to this theory might find support for it in
the magnificent physique of the present population
of this primeval country. At times, when a
sick man is sent back to breathe the air of his
native place after a lifetime spent in some distant
city, he gathers new health and strength in some
mysterious way. So tired humanity, sick and
undersized in Western Europe, regains its pristine
vigour and development among the mountains
and ravines where it first saw the light.</p>

<p>Not only were these men of Lazistan very fine
fellows themselves, but we saw that they possessed
some magnificent dogs, powerfully built, shaggy
coated animals, with enormous muscular strength.
These dogs were greatly prized by their owners;
and though I tried hard to secure one by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
purchase, I failed. They are used to guard the
flocks of their masters, and many a fierce duel has
been fought at night between a grey old wolf,
impelled by hunger to attack the sheep, and the
grim custodian of the flock. In the winter all the
mountains in Lazistan are covered with snow for
months, and the white covering of those lonely
grassy slopes is often stained by the traces of
these battles <i>à outrance</i>.</p>

<p>After completing our first day's journey, we
came in the evening to a small village, where we
put up at a filthy little khan, and made ourselves
as comfortable as we could. We had brought
plenty of food with us, and our principal discomfort
was as usual occasioned by the fleas, which
were as pertinacious as those which Thackeray
has depicted as pulling the Kickleburys out of
bed during their famous excursion up the Rhine.</p>

<p>On the second day we were able to push on
a good deal faster as the road was more level,
and in the evening we came to the small township
of Ghumish Khané, which was chiefly known
to fame owing to the existence of some very
old silver mines in the neighbourhood. To an
Australian like myself it did not look at all like
a mining township. Where were the familiar
poppet heads, the heaps of mullock, and the
diligently fossicked alluvial? There was no roar
of stampers, no monotonous gurgle of pumps,
and there was not one decent bush shanty in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
place. We had seen enough of the comforts of
a khan on the previous night, so like wise men
we went straight to the <i>hammam</i>, or Turkish
bath, with which even the smallest Turkish township
is always provided. Here we enjoyed the
refreshing luxury of being well steamed; and
backsheesh, in the shape of a few piastres to the
man in charge, procured for us permission to
sleep on the divans provided for patrons of the
establishment. We had supper and spent the
night in the hammam.</p>

<p>Leaving Ghumish Khané next morning, we
rode on through a narrow valley between two
ranges of hills covered with hazel trees and other
light scrub. In this valley, which was about
seven miles long by half a mile wide, we found
magnificent groves of pear trees fringing the road
on either side. When we passed through in the
middle of autumn, the fruit was just ripe, and
the great juicy pears almost knocked against our
faces as we rode on under the trees with the
branches interlacing overhead. We telegraphed
to the kaimakan at Baiburt, our next stopping-place,
before leaving Ghumish Khané, in order
that accommodation might be prepared for us;
and when we reached Baiburt in the evening,
we were agreeably surprised to find it an
extremely beautiful town. Baiburt, like all the
towns in that country, is a place of grey antiquity.
It sleeps on in the present, dreaming of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
past and of all the wars that have raged
about it since the first men of Baiburt built
themselves defences against the robbers of the
hills hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago.
It was taken by the Russians in 1828, after
the massacres in the Ægean Sea had roused
England, France, and Russia to take joint action
against the Turks, and had whetted the thirst
for blood once more by precipitating Navarino.
Looking at the majestic ruins of this town of
Baiburt and at the traces of their presence, left
there by the Russian cannoneers, one thought of
the causes that had brought about these ruins;
one thought of the Greek struggle for independence,
and of the massacres at Chios and the
adjacent islands; one thought of Byron singing
of "The Isles of Greece," with his passionate
appeal against "Turkish force and Latin fraud,"
and of Béranger stirring all Europe with the
lament of the heroic Ipsariotes, "Les rois
chrétiens ne nous vengeront pas."</p>

<p>After leaving Baiburt we got among the
mountains again, and rode along a track hewn
out of the side of the hills that almost overhung
us, a road that reminded one in places of the
magnificent solitudes of the Julier Pass in
Switzerland, and at times brought back the
softer beauties of the track from Hobart to the
Huon River in Tasmania.</p>

<p>On either side of the road grew groves of giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
rhododendrons, making splashes of rich colour
amid the green; and here and there the ruined
castles, built by Genoese merchant princes to
protect their commerce from the robbers of the
hills, loomed in lonely state above us. Along
this road in the Middle Ages came the greater
part of the trade from Persia; and as the long
caravan, laden with silks and spices, with fabrics
from the Persian looms and precious stones from
the Persian mines, made its way slowly towards
the markets of Europe, it was no wonder that the
brigands descended from their native fastnesses
and risked a fight with the well armed escort
that rode beside the treasures.</p>

<p>Inspired by a desire to get a nearer look at
these romantic old ruins, I climbed up to the
ridge upon which one of these castles was poised
like an eagle's nest between earth and heaven;
but I regretted my curiosity very quickly, for it
was only with the utmost difficulty and most
frantic clutching at convenient shrubs that I
reached the road again with a wild glissade in
which everything was forgotten except the instinctive
desire to keep myself right side uppermost.</p>

<p>Towards evening we passed through a gloomy
gorge where the cliffs rose perpendicularly on
each side; and the air, never warmed by the
sun's rays, was bitterly cold. Soon after emerging
from this we came to a village whose name I
have forgotten, and rode at once to the konak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
or townhall, where we had a rest and a meal.
Here I learnt that Sir Arnold Kemball was at
Purnekapan, at the end of the next stage, and
that he had with him Lieutenant Dugald of the
royal navy as an attaché.</p>

<p>Having sent a telegram to Lieutenant Dugald
notifying our approach, we resumed our journey,
travelling over a pass which rose to a height of
between six and seven thousand feet; and at the
summit we halted for an hour at a place called
the Kopdagh, from which there was a superb
view over hills and valleys and distant mountain-peaks.
Far away in front of us was the silver
line of a river, the very name of which sent a
thrill through our hearts. It was "that great
river, the river Euphrates"; and as we looked
down over the plain we realized, almost with a
gasp of astonishment, that we were gazing at the
legendary site of the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>At Purnekapan I called on Sir Arnold Kemball,
whom I had met previously at Nish during the
Servian war. Sir Arnold Kemball had stirring
news for us. He had just received a telegram
from Erzeroum announcing that the Russians
had delivered a terrific assault, and that the town
had fallen into their hands.</p>

<p>Next morning we pushed on as fast as we
could, crossed the Euphrates at midday, and at
five o'clock in the afternoon we reached Erzeroum.
As we entered the town we naturally expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
to find the Russians in possession of the town;
but we could see no trace of the well known
uniforms, and gradually it dawned upon us that
Sir Arnold Kemball had been misinformed when
he told us that the long expected Russian assault
had already been delivered.</p>

<p>We went straight to the British Consulate, and
called upon Mr. Zohrab, our consul, who gave
us a most cordial reception, and informed us of
the position in the town, which was certainly
serious. About a week before our arrival a
desperate attack had been made by the Russians,
who had taken one of the forts, and the Turks
lost two thousand men in killed and wounded.
Consequently the hospital resources were taxed
to the utmost, although in addition to the
Turkish medical staff there were several English
doctors in Erzeroum before we got there. Lord
Blantyre had sent up a number of English doctors
at his own expense; but the total strength of
the medical staff had been depleted by various
accidents. Dr. Casson and Dr. Buckle, for instance,
had been taken prisoners, and were then
in the hands of the Russians; Dr. Guppy had
died of typhoid fever about a week before we
got there; and the available surgeons were Charles
Fetherstonhaugh, James Denniston, whom I had
known before in Edinburgh, and John Pinkerton.
We took up our quarters with these three, in the
great bare house where they lived without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
furniture except a table and a couple of benches.
There were no beds, so we slept on the floor;
and our by no means luxurious meals were
cooked for us by an Armenian named David
whose son Siropé, commonly called Jonathan,
acted as waiter and general factotum.</p>

<p>As soon as we were installed we had time to
look round, and my first impression of Erzeroum
was a very favourable one. I found that we had
come to a very picturesque town, lying under the
lee of a range of mountains which rose to a
height of six thousand feet, the town itself being
about four thousand feet above the sea level. A
remarkable feature about the place was the entire
absence of timber, which I noticed at once with
the apprehension of an old campaigner who knew
the value of a supply of fuel and the horrible
discomfort of being without it. I found that the
nearest timber was seventy miles away, where
the great forest of Soghanli Dagh was situated.
There were very few trees in the town, and the
mountains were great masses of bare rock, without
a trace of vegetation to hide their cold nakedness.
Under these circumstances the inhabitants relied
for fuel principally on dried camel's dung, which
was a most precarious source of supply.</p>

<p>Erzeroum was surrounded by a great wall,
strengthened by forts at intervals, and also by a
moat and drawbridge. It was a very important
town, because nearly all the trade from Teheran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
went through it; and it had a population of
forty thousand inhabitants, most of whom were
Armenians. The houses were strongly built of
stone, with flat roofs, which were used by the
inmates as promenades during the warm evenings;
and the bright colours affected by the Turkish
women in their dress lent colour and animation
to the scene. The town contained several handsome
Armenian churches, the inner walls of
which were decorated with beautiful blue tiles;
and the konak, or townhall, was a very handsome
structure. The water supply was chiefly drawn
from wells, and there was besides a small stream
that came down from the mountains, while the
Euphrates was only four miles away.</p>

<p>Mr. Zohrab, who was to all intents and purposes
an Englishman, and had an English wife and two
sons, introduced all of us newcomers to Mukhtar
Pasha, the commander-in-chief, who welcomed us
most kindly, and thanked us for coming. We
found that Fetherstonhaugh, Denniston, and
Pinkerton were in charge of a large hospital,
which was known as Lord Blantyre's Hospital;
and I arranged to take over from the Turks a
large hospital which had been organized in the
Yeni Khan. Pinkerton agreed to come over to
me, as the other two could get through all the
work at Lord Blantyre's Hospital; so Pinkerton,
Woods, and myself, with Harvey and Captain
Morisot as assistants, were installed in the Yeni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Khan, and took over all the staff of assistants,
servants, and jarra bashis that had been employed
under the Turks. There were two of these
jarra bashis; and one of them, a Turkish sergeant,
who had been trained as a dresser, was one
of the hardest and most conscientious workers
as well as one of the best fellows that I met in
Turkey. I agreed to pay all those whom I took
over wages at the rate of half what they received
from the Turkish Government in addition to
their ordinary pay; and as they could never look
forward with any degree of certainty to receiving
their money from the Turks, they had an additional
incentive to faithful service, and I was
enabled to secure a direct control over them by
holding the power of the purse. I also took on
a Hungarian surgeon, named Schmidt, to assist
us. He was given a room in the hospital, and
was made the house surgeon; so that in cases of
hæmorrhage there was always a competent person
ready to arrest it until one of us could come up.</p>

<p>We soon had everything ship-shape in the old
khan, which was converted into a well equipped
hospital, containing at the outset three hundred
beds. It was very different from the awful
building that I had left behind in Plevna. The
main ward of our Stafford House Hospital was
a hundred feet long, with a width of sixty-five
feet and a height of thirty feet. It was ventilated
and lighted by means of large glass skylights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
and warmed by two large stoves. This ward
contained ninety-eight beds, and there was another
large one containing sixty-two beds, while smaller
rooms, opening off these large ones, provided
accommodation for six or eight patients each,
the total number of patients when I took over
control being three hundred. We had an operating-room,
a storeroom, and all the necessary offices.
In the main wards the scene was almost picturesque,
if any hospital ever could be picturesque;
for the place was scrupulously clean, and the beds
were dressed with Persian quilts, bright with the
most gorgeous colours. As the midday sunbeams
poured in through the skylights overhead, they
lit up the scarlets and the greens, the cobalt blues
and lemon yellows, the deep crimson of the rose,
the pink of the geranium, and the purple of the
violet, until the whole place looked like an
immense garden full of flowers. But against this
background of brilliant colours the white, drawn
faces of the wounded soldiers stood out in pitiful
contrast, and the gay hues only threw into still
stronger relief the ghastly sufferings.</p>

<p>At first we had no cases of sickness, and none
but wounded men to treat. Our death-rate was
low&mdash;in the first week we only had six deaths
out of three hundred patients, and we sent thirty
men out cured to rejoin their regiments. After
the hideous experiences in Plevna, this state of
things was a blessed relief, and we became quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
light-hearted. But before I left Erzeroum I
had seen sufferings and horrors before which
the sufferings and horrors of the Plevna hospital
paled into insignificance.</p>

<p>The first sign of coming trouble was the discovery
one morning of a case of genuine typhus
and several cases of typhoid. These we sent
away at once to the medical central hospital, as
we took over our hospital with the stipulation
that we were to treat only wounded cases. But
that solitary case of typhus worried me a good
deal, and it seemed to presage with dreadful
certainty the mischief that was to come.</p>

<p>As we went round the hospital wards, now that
fever had made its appearance, needless to
say that we examined each patient anxiously,
and every day we found three or four more cases
of typhus among the wounded men. These
we weeded out, and placed in a room specially
prepared to receive them, for on account of
the severity of their wounds we could not send
them away to the central hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in December the weather got very bad.
There was a heavy fall of snow, and the hospitals
were filled with sick, until altogether there were
about four thousand sick and wounded in the
town. Captain Morisot and Mr. Harvey were
most valuable assistants; but in the first week
of December Mr. Harvey, who was wanted at
Constantinople, had to leave, much to our regret.
Williams, our dragoman, who had been delayed
on the road by the bad weather, came up with
the stores, and took his place, turning out a very
useful assistant.</p>

<p>Pyæmia began to make great ravages, and
the intense cold increased the sufferings of the
wounded. I amputated a man's arm at the
shoulder joint, and hoped to pull him through;
but the weather beat me, for he took pleurisy,
and went off in a day.</p>

<p>Pinkerton, Woods, and myself lived in the
great, bare Armenian house with Fetherstonhaugh
and Denniston. Every morning we went
off to our respective hospitals, returned home to
lunch, and then went back in the afternoon to
work again. Wood for fuel cost us twopence
per pound, and rations were poor and scarce;
but we pegged away doggedly, and Mr. Zohrab
was very good to us. He had a splendid house
amply provisioned for the winter, and he was
most hospitable in his invitations to dinner; while
his wife, who was a charming Englishwoman, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
always cheering us up, and his two sons often
gave us a hand at the hospital.</p>

<p>An ominous silence was maintained by our
Russian besiegers, and we found that they had
withdrawn the greater number of the troops from
Erzeroum in order to carry out the assault on
Kars. Typhus, pyæmia, pneumonia, and the
bitter, deadening cold were working for the
Russians, and slew as many of the defenders of
Erzeroum daily as would have fallen under the
heaviest shell fire. Woods became ill; and as
there was evidently heavy work before us, I
sent him down to Constantinople, thus reducing
the strength of our little medical garrison by one.</p>

<p>Snow began to fall heavily, and soon the streets
were covered to a depth of several feet. At
night the thermometer dropped to forty degrees
below freezing-point, and the soldiers in the open
suffered severely. Every morning five or six
men were found frozen to death on outpost
duty, lying in the snow with their eyes closed
and their rifles clasped in their arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Melikoff was making
preparations for his great attack on Kars, and
at last the long expected assault was delivered,
and the Russians with their strange, untranslatable
cry of "Nichivo," which is the ultimate
expression of a reckless bravery that refuses to
count any cost, swept in upon the Turkish
batteries, and took the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Melikoff could not accommodate his numerous
wounded prisoners with quarters, so he conceived
the brilliant idea of sending them on to us; and,
presenting each man who could walk with a
blanket and a few piastres, he despatched the
men on their journey from Kars to Erzeroum.
What a march was that! The snow lay thickly
on the frozen ground, and for league after league
the legion of the wounded dragged themselves
along, staining the snow with their blood as
they "blazed" their pathway from Kars to
Erzeroum. Hundreds dropped dead on that
terrible march, and Mukhtar Pasha told me that
out of two thousand men who left Kars only
three hundred and seventeen reached Erzeroum.
About fifty of the survivors came to our hospital,
and one of them told me that he left with a
party of thirty, only ten of whom came through
alive, and of these ten no fewer than seven lost
all their toes from frostbite.</p>

<p>Some typical cases of frostbite were grotesque
in their ghastliness. Fancy the experience of
two men who came to us for treatment after
dragging their wounded bodies over the hundred
and eighty miles of snow that separated Kars
from Erzeroum. Their hands had been frost-bitten
early in the march, and for the last week
nothing was left but the skeleton of each hand
from the wrist to the finger-tips. Every particle
of flesh had rotted off, and the bones were black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
with decomposition. They came to me holding
out their blackened skeleton hands feebly and
pitifully before them, and I lopped off the maimed
remnants at the wrists. Both these men died
from the effects of that terrible march, which
not even the lurid imagination of a Dante could
easily rival.</p>

<p>We in our turn had to send out some of our
lightly wounded men to relieve the congested
hospitals and to diminish the chances of an
epidemic. On Christmas Day we sent away sixty-six,
most of whom were wounded in the hands
or arms, and they started to march to Baiburt.
We were able to give them warm jerseys, under-clothing,
long stockings, and woollen comforters,
thanks to the generosity of Lord Blantyre; and
three days later we sent out another thirty, each
of whom got ten piastres from Lord Blantyre's
fund in addition to the clothes. All of the men
reached Baiburt safely.</p>

<p>The hospitals were soon so crowded that
typhus and typhoid fever raged with added
violence, and hospital gangrene, that I had seen
before in Plevna, once more made its dreaded
appearance. We had eight cases in our hospital,
and lost three of them. Pyæmia and frostbite
were the other chief causes of mortality.</p>

<p>Pinkerton and I, with Morisot and Williams
to help us, managed our three hundred beds
fairly well; but it was a great blow to us when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Williams took the fever, and was added to the
sick list. When Pinkerton and myself met
Fetherstonhaugh and Denniston in the evenings
at dinner, we used to look at each other curiously,
wondering which would be the first. It was
Fetherstonhaugh. He was attacked by a kind
of remittent fever, but tried to shake it off and
went about his work as usual. One night, when
the rest of us were at dinner, Fetherstonhaugh
came into the dining-room, and remarked that
there were three men with their throats cut in
his room. We rushed in, but found nothing,
and came to the conclusion that it was time
Fetherstonhaugh left off work, so we sent him
down to Trebizond.</p>

<p>That was the last that I saw of him for a
long, long time; but the curious agency that for
want of a better name we call coincidence
brought us together again after many years in
a strange way. It happened in Melbourne,
when I had settled down to steady work at my
practice, and had almost forgotten the stirring
days in Asia Minor, except for a few rare
glimpses when memory lifted the veil. I was
engaged one day at the Supreme Court as a
professional witness in some case; and when I
stepped out of the box, it occurred to me that
I knew the face of a man who was sitting below
me in the body of the court.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Ryan, how are you?" he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked again, and recognized Denniston,
who told me that he had come out from
England on a trip, and had just strolled into the
court out of idle curiosity. As he was talking to
me, I looked through the door leading into the
passage, and saw another face that I recognized.</p>

<p>"I wonder what has become of Charlie
Fetherstonhaugh?" said Denniston.</p>

<p>"Look behind you. There he is," I replied,
as Charlie Fetherstonhaugh himself came up,
sound and hearty, having left the three men with
their throats cut behind him in the hospital at
Erzeroum. He too had dropped from the clouds,
and strolled into the court by mere chance. So
we had dinner together that evening, and great
was the jollification thereat.</p>

<p>At our Stafford House Hospital in Erzeroum
we had a continual stream of fresh cases, for the
cavalry were continually making dashes against
the Russians, and small affairs between outposts
came off nearly every day; so that as fast as one
lot of patients died or were discharged cured, a
second lot were brought in. Cases of frostbite
became very numerous, and many a time I had
to lop off a man's feet or hands the flesh of which
was simply rotting on the bones. Rations too
were getting scarce, and as there was not enough
food for every one the prisoners in the gaol were
the first to suffer. The interior of that Erzeroum
gaol was a sight not soon to be forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Crowded together in a state of indescribable filth,
the prisoners fought with the ferocity of wild
beasts for the few handfuls of raw grain that the
guard threw to them occasionally. Still, we continued
to get beef tea and mutton broth for our
wounded, and I made a point of going round the
wards and administering it myself to those who
needed it.</p>

<p>It was in connection with a matter of rations
that I remember Edmund O'Donovan especially.
O'Donovan was one of the wildest, most brilliant,
and original geniuses who ever left Ireland to
follow up the avocation of a war correspondent.
He came to dinner with us one night, and his wit
and versatility made a great impression upon me.
The next time that I saw him was in response to
an urgent request that I should call upon him and
get him out of a scrape. His adventure was so
thoroughly characteristic that I may be excused
for narrating it.</p>

<p>O'Donovan, it seemed, with the warm-hearted
generosity of his race, had invited half a dozen
Circassian officers to dine with him, and had prepared
an appetizing banquet for them. Among
the dishes was an entrée so savoury, so succulent,
so entirely satisfying to the palate of an epicure,
that the Circassians, like the simple children of
nature that they were, sent back their plates
again and again for more. There was something
new and strange yet delightful withal about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
entrée. The meat was white and delicate and
tender, the gravy was of a luscious brown, and in
a fit of absence of mind the Circassian officers
loaded up the whole cargo, while they laughed
politely at O'Donovan's best Dublin stories, which
were chiefly remarkable for having points where
one never expected them.</p>

<p>Then O'Donovan expressed a hope that they
had enjoyed the dinner, and the Circassians were
most effusive in their thanks. Really they had
never eaten anything like that entrée before, and
would their host mind telling them the recipe?</p>

<p>"Begorra, I can tell ye that aisy enough,"
spluttered O'Donovan, with a mighty laugh.
"Ye've been atin' the natest slip of a pig I've ever
seen out of Connaught, and beautifully cooked he
was too." Then he explained to them in Turkish
more clearly, and these good Mussulmen burst
into eruption. What a shindy there was at that
dinner-table! The Circassians could not have
been quicker if they had been at Donnybrook
Fair, and they rushed at their host with the first
weapons that came handy. O'Donovan did very
well with the bottles for a minute or two, and
afterwards with the leg of a chair; but they were
too many for him, and when the table was upset
and the lamps put out there was a fairly lively
five minutes round the wreck of the dinner-table
and of the empty dish that had once contained
a sucking-pig <i>à l'Irlandaise</i>. The Moslem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Circassians, full to repletion with the flesh of the
accursed creature, fought under a disadvantage;
and when O'Donovan's servants rushed in and
took their master's part, the issue was no longer
in doubt. Although the revolvers were going
freely, only one man was hurt, and it appeared
that O'Donovan had shot him in the arm. The
affair created a great deal of excitement at the
time, and the Circassians vowed vengeance for
the insult; but we managed to pacify them eventually,
and there were so many other things
requiring attention that the trouble soon blew
over.</p>

<p>This was not the only occasion that O'Donovan
got into a scrape, for not long afterwards,
while promenading on the roof of his house,
the idea occurred to him that a little revolver
practice might improve his aim. Drawing his
six-shooter, he proceeded to blaze away at a dog
that was gnawing a bone in the middle of the
street; but like another famous character in fiction,
he "missed the blue-bottle and floored the
Mogul." In other words, a bullet which went
wide of the dog found its billet in a fleshy part
of the body of a very stout Turkish woman, who
on receiving this flank attack fled in great disorder
screaming loudly.</p>

<p>O'Donovan sent for me to help him out of
this difficulty too, and we had to give the woman
£10 to square her. The erratic marksman was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
then the war correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>;
but I never saw an account of this incident in his
graphic descriptive sketches. He left Erzeroum
in December, and afterwards, when the army
of Hicks Pasha was cut to pieces in Egypt,
O'Donovan met a soldier's death.</p>

<p>At this time we lost the services of Mr. Zohrab,
the consul; for after the fall of Kars, Lord Derby,
desiring to avoid any complications in the event
of the Russians occupying Erzeroum, instructed
the British consul to retire at once to Constantinople.
Mr. Zohrab and his wife and sons
accordingly left the town, much to our regret, for
they had been very helpful to us. When he went,
however, he handed over to us his house, which
was fully provisioned, amply supplied with fuel,
and provided with a well stocked cellar. We
took possession at once, and after the poor kind
of way in which we had been living our new
quarters were most luxurious.</p>

<p>Although we personally were much better off
than before, yet the condition of the bulk of the
people in the town was getting steadily worse
every day. Stores of every kind were getting
scarce, and Kurd Ismael Pasha, who replaced
Mukhtar Pasha as commander-in-chief when that
officer was ordered to Constantinople, had a
difficult task in administration. Towards the
end of December it became necessary to relieve
the town of a portion of the population, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
expedition consisting of four hundred men and
two hundred women and children was ordered to
start for Erzinghan, a town which was supposed
to be five days' journey distant from Erzeroum.</p>

<p>This march rivalled in its horrors the march
of the wounded men from Kars; for before the
expedition had gone a day's journey from Erzeroum
a fearful snowstorm swept down upon the hapless
creatures, and when the miserable remnant had
dragged themselves back to their starting-point
it was found that of the two hundred women and
children not a single soul remained. All died
where they fell, including the wife of the colonel
commanding the expedition, and were buried
under the drifting heaps of snow that the wind
piled high over the uncoffined remains. Of the
soldiers who got back to Erzeroum the greater
number perished from frostbite, dysentery, and
exposure. It was an awful holocaust.</p>

<p>In spite of fever and dysentery, gunshot
wounds in horrible variety and septic disease
in every hospital, so strangely is the Anglo-Saxon
mind constituted that we decided to "enjoy ourselves"
at Christmas, although the Russians were
practically knocking at our gates. My previous
Christmas dinner consisted of a handful of maize
cobs eaten in solitude on the ice-bound road to
Orkhanieh. During the intervening year I had
lived and worked and suffered much&mdash;and almost
to my own astonishment I was still alive. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
here at Erzeroum I proposed to have a Christmas
festivity, and Pinkerton, Denniston, and Woods
eagerly accepted the suggestion. We decided to
invite all the European doctors in the town, and
to give them a real English Christmas dinner,
for which great preparations had to be made.</p>

<p>When we took over Mr. Zohrab's house, we
also assumed a right title and interest in the
services of two sturdy henchmen. One was
old Tom Rennison, who had been dragoman for
General Williams during the siege of Erzeroum
thirty years before, and the other was an Armenian
named Vachin. Tom Rennison, veteran campaigner
as he was, had never seen mince-pies
made, so to speak, under fire; and Vachin knew
more about the preparation of pilaf than plum
pudding. Consequently not only the arrangement
of the <i>menu</i>, but the actual work of cooking
it, devolved upon the medical staff; and I am
sorry to say that, though by this time there were
few things in surgery which we would not attempt,
from disarticulation of a thumb to amputation of
a thigh, nevertheless in the science of cooking
we were painfully unlearned. Lister was an
open book to us; but the dark sayings of Brillat-Savarin
were as obscure as the Rig-Vedas.</p>

<p>Pinkerton, Woods, and myself held a consultation
over the plum pudding, which was intended
to beget envy and jealousy in the hearts of the
Austrian and Hungarian doctors, and to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
dazzling example of the superiority of Anglo-Saxon
cooking over the unsubstantial kickshaws
of continental cuisines. I noticed that Vachin,
who was always an ill disposed fellow, looked
undisguisedly contemptuous of our preparations,
and that old Tom Rennison was obviously fluctuating
between the extremes of hope and fear. It
is not easy to recollect exactly what was in that
pudding. Denniston had heard that suet was an
ingredient of supreme importance, so the yellow
fat was cut from the joint of beef which had been
moving about the yard only two days before as
the sirloin of Mr. Zohrab's best heifer. We found
plenty of currants and raisins among the stores;
but there was no candied peel, and the spices
which had been imported from Teheran somehow
smelt quite unlike the unconvincing substance
that we remembered to have seen in our youth
at the suburban grocer's. We had plenty of flour
of course, and we mixed our <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> in a big
brown pot. It was a viscous, &oelig;dematous mass,
of the consistency of soft indiarubber, when we
had done mixing it, and it resembled nothing so
much as a bucketful of Zante currants which had
fallen by accident into a glue-pot. The other
fellows made some very discouraging remarks;
but I tied up the ghastly mixture in half a clean
sheet, and sat up all night on Christmas Eve
boiling it in the iron pot.</p>

<p>On Christmas night we had a grand banquet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
and about twenty other European doctors came
in answer to our invitations to receive our hospitality.
We explained to them at some length
that we were going to give them a real English
dinner, which was a treat that they had probably
never enjoyed before, and very likely might
never enjoy again.</p>

<p>Certainly the beef was a little tough, as the
hapless heifer had only been sacrificed on the
previous day, and then there was no horse-radish
and very little gravy; but the geese were first-rate.
Like everything else in Asia Minor, they
were evidently of great antiquity. Probably they
had seen the former siege of Erzeroum; but age,
which weakens most other things, had strengthened
their limbs and steeled their muscles, until to
disintegrate the closely knitted tissues was a
veritable feat of strength, and one swallowed a
mouthful with the comfortable glow of satisfaction
that follows the surmounting of a desperate
difficulty. Of the mince-pies I cannot speak
with certainty, for Woods had taken complete
control over the manufacture of these delicious
delicacies, and, much as I respected my colleague,
I was suspicious of his ingredients. I can testify,
however, from the simple experience of lifting
one up from the dish that the mince-pies were
solid and weighty additions to the <i>menu</i>. I
waited with some anxiety for the pudding, and
the happiness that the artist feels in a work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
completed came over me as I saw old Tom
Rennison bearing in the dish containing the
pudding, surrounded by leaping tongues of blue
flame from the burning brandy. Up to this
period the Hungarian doctors had been politely
complimentary, and had accepted slabs of heifer's
flesh as hard as boot leather and chunks of goose
that would have made excellent ammunition for
siege artillery as typical dishes of a correct
English dinner. By dint of washing the food
down with plenty of wine and many tumblers of
brandy-and-water, they struggled along gamely
through the first courses; but when they received
their portions of the plum pudding they distinctly
jibbed. With the flames playing round its
charred, excoriated surface, it certainly had a diabolical
look, and it held together with a glutinous
consistency that for an appreciable number of
seconds defied the attack even of a carving-knife.
The Hungarian doctors viewed their plates with
an alarmed suspicion that was too genuine to
be concealed, and I must confess that when I
got a spoonful of my masterpiece into my mouth
the taste did not compensate in the least for
the difficulty of detaching the fragment from the
surrounding bed-rock. That was the first and
last time that I cooked a plum pudding.</p>

<p>In spite of these little drawbacks, however,
we all thoroughly enjoyed our Christmas dinner,
and we made a fair hole in Mr. Zohrab's cellar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
which was well stocked with wines and spirits
and also with beer and porter. The dawn was
coming up over the snow on the distant hills
when we separated, laughing, singing, and wishing
each other a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year.</p>

<p>Within a fortnight nearly every one of us was
down with typhus, and within a month more than
half of our number were dead.</p>

<p>The first of the English doctors to catch the
fever was poor Pinkerton. He was always
terribly frightened of it, and used to carry quantities
of camphor about in his pockets as a
disinfectant; but with the epidemic raging as
it was, any attempt at personal disinfection for
a medical man attending the cases was practically
hopeless. Pinkerton was always talking
about his dread of getting typhus, and saying
that if he caught it he would never get over
it. This made Denniston and myself very
anxious about him; for though he was a splendidly
built, handsome fellow, with an excellent
constitution, his apprehensions laid him open to
attack more readily, and would certainly decrease
his chance of recovery if the fever got its clutch
upon him. Wrought up to a state of high
nervous tension by continually moving among
the sick and the dying, it was not to be wondered
at that we attached significance to the veriest
trifles, and both Denniston and myself recollected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
with dismay that every one of our patients who
had had a presentiment of death up to that time
had died.</p>

<p>On the last day of the old year Pinkerton
became ill, and we put him to bed. He was
very despondent, and I could see at once that
he had an attack of the most malignant typhus.
He was a very bad patient, and would take
neither his medicine nor his nourishment without
a great deal of trouble. Our number was now
reduced to two, and Denniston and myself looked
at each other every morning with questioning
gaze. Fortunately Denniston had had malignant
typhus in his student days at Glasgow, and was
not likely to take it again, while I felt that if I
could only pull through we might still be able
to keep on the two hospitals. After three or
four days Pinkerton fell into a semi-comatose
condition, from which he never emerged, but lay
in bed moaning feebly, and talking incoherently
at intervals of fighting and of operations and of
places and people whose names were unfamiliar
to me.</p>

<p>How clearly those dreadful days come back!
We had the ever present, bitter, numbing cold,
and the ceaseless work in the hospital as one
passed from bed to bed, from the moaning
wounded to the poor wretches who were being
consumed by the fires of fever, and thence to
the ghastly mutilated creatures who had lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
hands, feet, ears, and even noses by frostbite.
Then there was in addition the anxiety about
Pinkerton, and the fear that one or both of us
two survivors would succumb to the strain, and
thus leave the bulk of the sick and wounded
without medical succour. In addition to it all
was the nervous strain of waiting for the expected
Russian attack, which would have been gladly
welcomed as a relief from the intolerable tension.</p>

<p>During these early days of January, 1878, the
mortality in Erzeroum was something appalling.
Out of a total number of about seventeen thousand
troops in the town, there were on one day no
fewer than three hundred and two deaths, and
the daily death-rate frequently rose to two
hundred! The weak, emaciated survivors had
hardly strength left to dig graves for their dead
comrades in the hard and frozen ground. At
last they gave up even the pretence of digging,
and the bodies were simply carted out about a
mile from the main thoroughfares of the town,
and left in the snow just inside the city walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course all conveyances were placed on
runners while the snow was on the ground, and
the little sleighs which served as dead-carts
passed our house every morning at about ten
o'clock with their mournful loads collected from
the various hospitals. The bodies of the dead
soldiers were stripped of their clothing and
wrapped in clean white sheets according to the
Moslem custom. Each little sleigh contained
ten or twelve bodies, and as I looked out in the
morning I could see the burial parties going out
on duty. The white-sheeted corpses were packed
closely together; and as the sleighs had no tailboards
and were very small, the naked feet of
the corpses projected out at the back in a horribly
grotesque fashion. As the little vehicles, which
were dragged by the fatigue squads, glided in
ghostly silence over the frozen snow a long howl
in the distance broke the stillness. This was
taken up by another, and another, and another,
until the voices of fully fifteen hundred famished
dogs came through the crisp, clear wintry air
with terrible significance, chilling the marrow of
the listener as he watched the long procession of
helpless, white-sheeted corpses moving slowly over
the white-sheeted ground. A Parsee's obsequies,
when the filthy vultures flap their wings and gather
to the feast, must be an eerie sight; a Gussein's
funeral in the Ganges, where the great flat-nosed
alligators swarm expectantly, must stir even the
sluggish imagination of the impassive Hindoo.
But surely no man ever had more dreadful burial
rites than were celebrated daily over hundreds of
the dead inside the walls of Erzeroum, where the
famished dogs disputed the possession of the poor
mutilated remnants with sickening ferocity, and
where the only prayers over the bodies of the
dead were the muttered growls of the worrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
pack. There is a short passage in "The Siege of
Corinth" which exactly describes the grisly scene.
Lord Byron wrote of Alp the renegade as he
paced under the walls of Corinth these lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
And he saw the lean dogs beneath the wall<br />
Hold o'er the dead their carnival,<br />
Gorging and growling o'er carcase and limb.<br />
They were too busy to bark at him.<br />
From a Tartar's skull they had stripped the flesh<br />
As ye peel the fig when its fruit is fresh,<br />
And their white tusks crunched o'er the whiter skull<br />
As it slipped through their jaws when their edge grew dull,<br />
As they lazily mumbled the bones of the dead<br />
When they scarce could rise from the spot where they fed.<br />
</div>

<p>In this passage the poet has described with
more detail than one cares to give in a plain
narrative the scene which was enacted every
morning in the early part of that month of
January within the walls of Erzeroum.</p>

<p>It was about January 8 that I took the
fever, which was by this time ravaging both the
civil and military population. At first I tried to
shake it off, and continued to walk about with
aching head and quaking limbs in the hope that
it might not have got a fair hold of me. On the
second day I became quite stupid, though I still
refused to go to bed, and on the evening of that
day Pinkerton died.</p>

<p>Next morning we buried him. Wood was so
difficult to get, that we were put to great straits
to make a coffin for him; but at last we contrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
one out of an old packing-case. Pinkerton was
a very tall man, and the flimsy coffin was hardly
big enough for the body. There was scarcely
enough wood to make the lid fit properly. When
we were making the preparations for the burial,
I was myself nearly delirious with typhus, and
almost the last thing that I can remember before
going off altogether was the sight of the miserable
coffin with a gaping crevice in the top, through
which the end of poor Pinkerton's silky fair beard
was protruding. Denniston notified Hakki Bey,
the civil governor, of our loss; and an escort of
soldiers came down and buried our comrade by
the side of Dr. Guppy, who had died on duty in
the same place before we arrived there. The
burial service was read by the Rev. Mr. Cole,
an American missionary, who was in Erzeroum,
accompanied by his wife and family and by a
young American lady, also engaged in missionary
work among the Armenians. Then the soldiers
fired a volley over the grave, and the career of
the fine young army surgeon was closed.</p>

<p>When I was put to bed, the whole strength of
the medical and assisting staff of the two English
hospitals, Lord Blantyre's Hospital and that of the
Stafford House Committee, was reduced to one
man, namely, Dr. Denniston. Guppy and Pinkerton
were dead, and Williams, Morisot, and myself
were down with typhus. Under these circumstances,
Denniston was left with the two hospitals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
full of patients to look after as well as us three at
home, and he rose to the occasion most heroically.</p>

<p>Of course at that time I was unconscious of
everything, but I found out afterwards what
happened. Denniston handed the English hospital
back to the Turkish administration which
had managed it before our arrival, and he secured
an assistant from the French consul to help him
with the other one and with us. He told me
afterwards that I made a very good patient, but
I doubt it. I can just remember him coming in
to see me one day and giving me a pill, which,
though I was almost delirious, I made a great
pretence of swallowing, but really kept it under
my tongue and spat it out as soon as he had
left the room!</p>

<p>The American missionary, Mr. Cole, used to
come and sit with me sometimes. I had known
him before I was ill, and admired his character
greatly. He seemed to me to be a very fine
type of man and a true Christian. In Erzeroum
at that time the healing of souls was attended
with as much danger as the healing of bodies,
and there were martyrs in both causes. Mr.
Cole lost one of his children from typhus, and
the bright, winning, and enthusiastic young
American lady who was working as a missionary
in conjunction with him and Mrs. Cole also laid
down her life in the noble service in which she
had engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>During the day, while Denniston was away at
the hospital fighting a desperate single-handed
battle against wounds and disease of every kind,
we patients at home had many kindly visitors.
Morisot and Williams got over the worst of the
illness sooner than I did; but for some time we
all required watching.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that during my illness I
grievously erred against good taste, and quite
forgot the esteem and regard which I venture
to believe I had always hitherto shown towards
ladies. The fact of the matter was that I had
seen so few ladies in the past eighteen months
that the sight of them irritated and annoyed my
disordered brain exceedingly. So it came about
that, when two sweet-faced French nuns, who
had heard from Dr. Denniston of his desperate
need for nurses, called in and visited me, I viewed
their presence with the profoundest suspicion and
distrust. I had been working for so long among
great, strong, hairy-faced Turks that my delirious
imagination failed to recognize these two young
nuns, with their rustling skirts and their soft
white hands, as fellow creatures at all, and I
expressed such terror and alarm at their appearance
that the poor things were obliged to fly.
In the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i> there is a picture of
François Xavier Auguste, the gay <i>mousquetaire</i>,
sitting up in bed in an attitude of horror, while
on chairs at each side of his pillow sit duplicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
images of Sister Thérèse. I must have looked
very much like that when the well meaning nuns
came in to sit by me, and found my language and
demeanour so terrifying that they had to decamp
at once, leaving me to the less exciting ministrations
of a dear old Capuchin monk called Father
Basilio, who was sent to take their place. He
used to sit up with me in the long night watches
and humour all my fancies, kindly old soul that
he was; but I think he never expected that I
would pull through.</p>

<p>Though young in years, I was a veteran as
far as horrors were concerned, and I can truthfully
say that I was absolutely without fear of
death. Possibly it was this that saved me, for
I remember telling Denniston at the worst
period of my illness that he need have no fear
on my account, for I had not the slightest intention
of "pegging out."</p>

<p>I was very bad for about twelve days, and the
events of that time of illness impressed themselves
on my brain in the vaguest and most
indistinct manner. Still, it is interesting from
the scientific point of view to note that impressions
can be made even upon a semi-comatose
brain which are sufficiently strong to be of
subsequent use. The negatives on the convolutions
of the brain were not very sharply
outlined; but the will, like a skilful photographer,
could retouch them afterwards until they made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
perfect picture. This scientific fact I was able
to demonstrate myself, to the great confusion
of our Armenian dragoman Vachin.</p>

<p>It happened this way. When I recovered
from the fever, I was helping Denniston to
make an inventory of poor Pinkerton's personal
effects, so that we could send them to his relatives,
when we made the unpleasant discovery that
a sum of £20 which he had in his possession
was missing. Pinkerton used to carry the money
in Turkish liras in the pocket of his trousers;
and as I had been shifted into his room after his
death because it was larger and airier than my
own, his trousers were hanging on a nail on
the wall right opposite my bed. We examined
the pockets, but they were empty.</p>

<p>Then I began to think back and to think
hard. Gradually there appeared before the eye
of my mind the picture of a shadowy, misty,
unsubstantial figure, that wobbled grievously
from side to side as it walked, and seemed to
turn round and round with the room, the
bed, the chair, and the window, which all swung
and oscillated like the engines of the little
Messageries steamer that brought us up to
Trebizond. What on earth was the captain of
the Messageries steamer going to do! and how
the little tub was rolling, to be sure! Was
it the captain, though, or some one else? I
fastened all the will power of my brain, healthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
once more, upon the misty shadow cast upon
its disordered surface during illness. I saw the
scene again, more distinctly now, and noted that
the wobbling figure approached the wall exactly
at the spot where the trousers hung on the nail
opposite my bed. The engines seemed to be
slowing down, little by little the room ceased
to revolve, and at last the figure turned round
towards my bed, and I saw the face. It was
not the captain of the steamer, but it was Vachin,
our dragoman, and he was deliberately counting
out money from poor Pinkerton's trousers pocket.</p>

<p>All this came back to me with greater clearness
the longer I thought over it; and at last
I felt morally certain that Vachin was the thief,
and that he had cynically taken the money
before my eyes, knowing that I was delirious,
and confident that I would never recover to
bear witness against him.</p>

<p>We taxed the Armenian with the theft; and
when I told him that it was no use denying it,
for I had seen him take the money, he confessed
his guilt. A short consultation between
Denniston and myself was followed by the
despatch of a note to Hakki Bey, the civil
governor; and as a punishment for misdeeds
in the past and an incentive to virtue in the
future, Vachin was consigned to the Erzeroum
general prison pending the pleasure of the
governor. We got back the £20 from him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
before he went, and for three weeks we left
him in a place, from which the Black Hole of
Calcutta would have been a pleasant change,
to meditate upon the instability of human
happiness. We sent him some blankets and
also food at intervals, besides going up occasionally
to see how he was getting on and
whether he was truly repentant. The condition
of the unfortunate wretch, however, was so deplorable,
and the interior of that prison, with
its gangs of half-frozen, half-starved prisoners
fighting fiercely among themselves for the scanty
dole of raw grain and old rags that were thrown
among them by the gaolers, was so distressing,
that we relented, and procured a release for
our thievish dragoman from Hakki Bey. On
the night that he was discharged from prison
he deserted to the Russians, and we never saw
him again. And so farewell to Vachin.</p>

<p>When I rose from my sick-bed I was very thin
and weak; but under Denniston's care I soon
picked up my strength, and at last he allowed
me to go out for a walk. It was the first week
in February, and the snow was beginning to
melt on the low ground; although beyond the
valley in which Erzeroum stood it still lay thick
upon the hills, and Kopdagh in the distance rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
to a crystal spear-point of dazzling whiteness
outlined sharply against the sky.</p>

<p>Contrasted with the serene purity of the mountain
heights, the squalid horrors of Erzeroum in
the valley struck home to the imagination with
redoubled force. Here and there, as I paced
through the streets with the unsteady gait and the
frequent pauses of a man scarcely yet recovered
from fever, I could see in the dirty, brownish,
melting slush grim evidences of disease and
death. The hordes of dogs which infested the
town had dragged the bones of the dead men who
had been abandoned to them into the very streets;
and as the snow which hid the poor remains for
a time began to melt, the bones reappeared in
ghastly fashion. Close to the doorstep of our own
quarters I saw a skull picked as clean as a piece
of ivory; and before I had gone a hundred yards
another pitiable sight met my eyes. It was the
bone of a man's arm, from which the hand was
missing, and the cleanness of the cut showed that
it had been amputated during life. Probably it
had been a case of frostbite. On every side, as I
walked on feebly and slowly, I saw these human
remains peeping shamefacedly from the snow
that would no longer cover them; and a few
inquiries showed me that while I was raving
with the fever and unconscious of all around me,
terrible things had been happening in Erzeroum.
The place had become a veritable pesthouse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
and while the civil and military population had
alike fallen under the scourge of typhus, by far
the heaviest losses had occurred in the ranks of
the medical staff. No fewer than twenty-seven
doctors had been attacked by the disease; and
the malignant form in which it appeared may be
gauged from the fact that of these twenty-seven
more than half had succumbed. Of the survivors
I was one. I knew then&mdash;and have remembered
it ever since&mdash;that I owed my life to the skill and
care of that devoted surgeon James Denniston.</p>

<p>Looking round the fever-stricken town, I saw
on every hand dead men lying in the snow, and
living men, worn to shadows like myself, crawling
feebly about the streets; while outside the gates
the Russians were waiting grimly until the thaw
should enable them to bring up their artillery
and complete the work that sickness had begun.
Then lifting my eyes to the mountains, I saw
them rearing their unapproachable pinnacles to the
sky, far above human suffering and weakness.
The shadows of the clouds moved across the face
of one great snow-field to the southward, but the
ice-peak that pierced the blue above was iridescent
in the sunlight. It seemed like an illustration
of the words of that French poet who wrote:</p>

<div class="poem">
En haut la cime,<br />
En bas l'abîme.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">. . .</span><br />
En haut mystère,<br />
En bas misère.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>As I drew near our quarters again after my
short walk, I saw a small crowd gathered near
the door; and next minute I was shaking hands,
with a heart too full for words, with my old
friends Dr. Stoker and Dr. Stiven, who had
come up from Constantinople on a mission of
relief.</p>

<p>When I fell ill and Denniston was left alone, he
managed to get a letter away to Constantinople
through the Russian lines announcing the precarious
position in Erzeroum, and Dr. Stoker and
Dr. Stiven at once volunteered to come up as a
rescue party. Reaching Trebizond on January 27,
they pushed forward at once, preparations for
the journey having been expedited by Mr.
Biliotti; but they had to stop most of the first
night at Jevislik to rest the post-horses, and
here the hazardous nature of their undertaking
was brought home to them. An early start was
made next morning, and all that day these two
heroic men pushed on with tired horses, a reluctant
guide, and one hundred and fifty miles
of snow and ice in front of them. The road was
excessively difficult, for the little pathway, about
two feet wide, was frozen and slippery, and
wound along the edge of a cliff about nine
hundred feet high, while snowdrifts, which in
some places were twenty feet deep, threatened
to engulf them. Several times the baggage-horses
fell, and the whole party had to halt and unpack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
and reload the animals; so that the march was
much delayed, and it was two hours after dark
before they reached the summit of the Zegana
Pass, where they camped for the night. The
next day they reached Ghumish Khané, and
there for the first time since leaving Trebizond
they got a relay of post-horses. A long struggle
of eighteen hours brought the relief party from
Ghumish Khané to Baiburt; and after procuring
fresh horses with some difficulty, they pushed
on to the Kop village at the foot of the worst
pass on the whole road.</p>

<p>Here another misfortune befell them; for the
guide, who had been showing an inclination to
give in for several stages past, refused when
they were half-way up the mountain to go a step
farther, declaring that it was madness to attempt
the pass in such weather, and that they were
courting certain death from the avalanches that
they could hear at intervals thundering down
into the valley below.</p>

<p>Taking their lives in their hands, the two
doctors left the guide to make his way back
as best he could, and faced the rising path again,
taking the pack-horses with them. Once the
whole party were submerged in a snowdrift,
but managed to get clear again; and after a
great struggle of nine hours, they passed the
Kopdagh, and arrived at a place called Purnekapan,
where they learnt that they were close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the Russian outposts. At the top of the pass the
snow lay so thick that, had it not been for the
telegraph poles, the whole party must have lost
their way and perished; but by dint of following
the track thus marked out they were able to
advance as far as Ashkaleh, where a Cossack
guard was stationed. Hoisting the British flag
and also the ambulance flag, the intrepid doctors
were escorted by the Cossacks to Ilidja, where
they were well received by the Russian general
Sistovitch; and after some delay, caused by the
necessity of telegraphing to the Grand Duke
Michael for permission, they were allowed to
go on to Erzeroum, which they reached on
February 3. Surely that hazardous relief march
of seven whole days, undertaken voluntarily, and
carried out with unswerving resolution in the face
of every danger, should live in the annals of the
medical profession as an example of the unflinching
devotion of the two brave men who made it.</p>

<p>Stoker and Stiven told me that the news of
my illness had been received in Constantinople
with great regret, and they had orders if they
found me alive on their arrival at Erzeroum to
send me down to the capital at once to recuperate.
They also brought me an invitation from
Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Commerell, who was
stationed in the Gulf of Ismet, to pay him a visit
on board his ship for the purpose of regaining
my health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>However, it went against the grain with me
to think of leaving a sinking ship; and at last
we arranged that Stiven should go back, taking
Captain Morisot with him, and that Stoker should
remain with Denniston and me to look after
the hospitals. So we said good-bye to Stiven
and Morisot, and devoted ourselves anew to the
hospital work. During my illness the Stafford
House Hospital, which had been handed back
to the Turkish authorities, had been allowed to
go to the bad very much; but after four or five
days' hard work we soon had everything ship-shape
again.</p>

<p>At this period the sickness in the city was
at its worst, and the ravages of typhus and
typhoid were fearful. We three English doctors
had our hands full, and whenever we had an
hour to spare from the military hospital our
time was taken up in attending upon the poorer
Armenians in the city. We could have earned
large fees if we had chosen to attend the wealthier
classes; but we thought it right to devote all
our spare time to the poor people, who had no
one else to look after them.</p>

<p>Among our patients was the Catholic Armenian
archbishop of the place, a dear old fellow,
who was most grateful to Denniston and myself
for attending him. When he recovered he
wanted us to take a fee, but we declined; and
then he insisted on presenting us with the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
article of value which he possessed. This was a
bracelet which had been excavated from a subterranean
village of great antiquity at the foot of
Mount Ararat, and consisted of a large ring of
bronze, ornamented with two serpents' heads. It
was supposed to be about two thousand three
hundred years old or thereabouts. We accepted
this strange old ornament, which might have been
fashioned by some cunning artificer whose father
saw the sunlight flashing on the Athenian helmets
at Marathon or watched the beak of a Greek
galley come crashing through the Persian ship in
which he laboured at the oar at Salamis. The
serpents on the old bronze bracelet had slumbered
on in the subterranean village while centuries came
and went and dynasties flitted past like shadows;
but at last they were restored again to the light
of day. Denniston and I regarded our new
acquisition with curiosity not unmixed with awe.
Then in our simple, unpoetical way we decided
to toss up for it, and the spin of a Turkish piastre,
minted so to speak but yesterday, gave Denniston
possession of this souvenir of the times of mighty
Xerxes.</p>

<p>As soon as it leaked out that archæological
objects were regarded with interest by the
English doctors, an extraordinary variety of
ancient curiosities were pressed upon our notice;
and owing to the precarious situation in the town,
the owners were all ready to sacrifice their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
treasures at an alarming reduction. There was
something pathetic in the eagerness of a few of
these collectors to realize upon their treasures. I
was offered an iron signet ring supposed to have
belonged to an exalted personage in the time
of Alexander the Great for the price of a few
doses of quinine; and half a bottle of brandy
would have purchased me a curious black stone
bearing an inscription that would puzzle the
antiquity experts at the British Museum. One
day an Armenian named Magack, who held an
official position in the British Consulate, brought
me a gold coin stamped with a bull's head. He
explained to me that it was coined in the reign of
the second Persian king, and that it was worth
<i>£</i>70 in London; but the evidence on one point
seemed to me as inconclusive as on the other, and
I declined to purchase it at the price of <i>£</i>30.</p>

<p>Although the snow had begun to melt in the
streets, it was still bitterly cold, and we knew that
the Russians were only waiting for a regular
thaw in order to bring up their artillery. However,
we were fortunately not called upon to
undergo a bombardment; for with the fall of Kars
and Plevna the war was virtually at an end both
in Asia Minor and in Europe, and rumours of an
armistice were already beginning to be put about.</p>

<p>At last one day I saw a couple of Russian
cavalry officers in the town; and hurrying back
to my quarters as fast as possible, I sent old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Tom Rennison up to headquarters to find out
what had happened. He brought back news
that they were two <i>parlementaires</i>, who brought
telegrams from Constantinople <i>viâ</i> St. Petersburg,
notifying the commander-in-chief that the town
would be occupied by Russian troops in accordance
with the terms of an armistice.</p>

<p>When old Kurd Ismail Pasha heard this news,
he wept tears of rage and tore his beard in a
frenzy of grief. The troops also, in spite of their
terrible losses by wounds and sickness, were very
despondent at the prospect of the town being
occupied by the enemy without another blow
being struck in its defence. Lamentations, however,
were useless; and two days later the gates
were opened, and General Melikoff, surrounded
by his staff, rode into Erzeroum, and took up
his quarters in the town.</p>

<p>On the same night, just as Denniston, Stoker,
and myself were sitting down to a good dinner in
our comfortable quarters, four Russian doctors,
who had come in with Melikoff, called at our
house. They belonged to the Russian Red
Cross Society, and explained that they did not
know where to go for the night; so we sent their
horses round to our stable, and we invited them
to dine with us and stay the night&mdash;an invitation
which they gladly accepted. We gave them a
capital dinner, which they enjoyed very much;
and the only thing that marred the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
success of the gathering was the difficulty under
which conversational intercourse had to be
carried on.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that my deplorable
deficiencies in the matter of conversational French
actually endangered my life, which I had managed
to preserve up till then, in spite of shot
and shell, fever and frostbite. Neither Stoker
nor Stiven had pursued his studies in the
language of diplomacy much farther than the
irregular verbs which tormented them in their
fourth-form days at school; and my own French,
painfully acquired during my early days in
Australia, and never afterwards improved by
practice, was distinctly of the Stratford-atte-Bow
variety. Consequently the natural embarrassment
of finding conversation for the enemy within our
gates as well as dinner was increased by the
difficulty which we experienced in achieving any
remark which we considered it in good taste to
utter. Drifting naturally to professional subjects,
I made a reference to our colleagues Dr. Casson
and Dr. Buckby, who were captured by Cossacks
on their way from Kars to Erzeroum, after
having been under fire with Mukhtar Pasha's
troops at the fighting round Eolia-tepe and
Nalban-tepe. I wanted to say that I had heard
that the Russians treated the two doctors who
were taken prisoners with great kindness, and
made things as pleasant as possible for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
What I did say, however, falling into the common
schoolboy error of attempting to render an idiom
in one language by a phrase of similar sound in
another, was this. "J'ai entendu," I remarked,
with a smile intended to convey grateful appreciation
of services rendered, but which was
interpreted as a sinister and sardonic grimace
denoting a deliberate intention to insult, "que
vous avez fait beaucoup de plaisanteries pour
nos deux amis." There was an awkward pause.
It was just that sort of pause which occurs
at a large dinner party when you inquire
audibly from your neighbour the name of the
hideously ugly woman who is sitting opposite,
and he replies that it is his wife. Then the
four Russian doctors began to jabber excitedly
to each other, and one of them, jumping to his
feet, hurled half a dozen rapid sentences at me,
which I dimly felt denoted astonishment, anger,
and a demand for satisfaction. It was very
clear that I had put my foot in it somehow;
but to correct my mistake I strove in vain. The
more I said the less it pleased our guests, who
loudly insisted upon a duel. This was a pretty
go. Morisot, who would have been my best
friend in this emergency, was unfortunately in
Constantinople; but necessity sharpens one's wits
wonderfully, and it flashed upon me in a moment
that Magack, the owner of the gold coin with
the bull's head that was stamped during the reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of the second Persian king, could speak French
admirably. Accordingly the invaluable numismatist
was summoned in hot haste; and although
I am sure that he never forgave me for not
buying that bull's head, he condescended to
explain to our guests the difficulty in which the
defects of my education had landed me. The
Russian doctors turned out to be very good
fellows after all, and when they left us General
Melikoff sent an aide to thank us for the hospitality
which we had shown to them.</p>

<p>Captain Serge Pizareff was the name of the
aide-de-camp who came to call on us, and a
very pleasant young fellow he was. He told
us that the Russians would make a formal entry
into the town next day; and that if we liked to
see the spectacle, he would send us horses and
place himself at our disposal, an offer which,
needless to say, we accepted.</p>

<p>There was one thing about Captain Serge
Pizareff which struck me very favourably. He
had been to England, and spoke English as
well as most Englishmen. I argued from that
circumstance that the Russian doctors must have
dropped a hint as to our deficiencies in the matter
of French; but I was prepared to overlook the
humiliation for the sake of the convenience.</p>

<p>We got a capital view of the spectacle, thanks
to the kindness of Captain Pizareff; for some
Cossacks brought us horses in the morning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
we rode out to the large open space inside the
walls where the demonstration was to take place.
It was a most impressive demonstration. Outside
the town a <i>corps d'armée</i> of sixty thousand
Russian troops, belonging to all branches of the
service, was stationed in the various villages.
It was not deemed advisable to bring them all
in at once; but detachments from every regiment,
including cavalry, infantry, and artillery, were
marched forward and brigaded outside the gates.
Then at the word of command, while the bands
played the regimental quicksteps, they came forward,
with colours flying, and entered Erzeroum
without striking a blow, across the ground where
those same regiments had been swept by the fire
from the redoubts along the walls a couple of
months before, and had been hurled back in
terrible disorder.</p>

<p>General Melikoff reviewed his troops in the
great open space between the town and the
redoubts which defended the walls. It was a
crisp, clear, exhilarating day, and the hard,
smooth surface of the glistening snow was still
strong enough to bear the troops without sinking
in, though here and there an officer's horse would
put his foot through the solid crust into the soft
powdery snow below and flounder back again,
plunging and snorting.</p>

<p>We three Englishmen sat there on the Cossacks'
shaggy, hardy little horses, and watched with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
mingled feelings the triumphant military display
of the great Northern power which was celebrating
the close of a victorious campaign. We guessed
by a kind of instinct that England herself had
come within measurable distance of war with the
same great power; but we scarcely realized that
the issue was still hanging in the balance, and that
the steady hand of one man held the scales of
war and peace. The treaty of San Stefano had
just been signed. This document, which the
Sultan ratified on March 3, concluded the war
between Russia and Turkey; but the Ottoman
Government had to buy peace at a price. Not
only was an indemnity of three hundred million
roubles secured to Russia, but she also took large
possessions in Asia Minor and enormous advantages
in Europe.</p>

<p>While we sat on the horses of the Cossack
irregulars listening to the huzzas of the Russian
troops, Lord Beaconsfield, with the provisions of
the treaty before him, was evolving the policy
of England. It was not until May 15 that he
returned to London with Lord Salisbury, after
the Berlin Congress, bringing back "peace with
honour."</p>

<p>As we dangled our feet in the big Cossack
stirrups watching the Russian standards that
made shadows on the snow as they waved lazily
in the breeze, a British squadron was steaming
to Besika Bay, and the Government of India was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
preparing to despatch a strong force of Indian
troops to Malta. That was because Russia
refused to submit the treaty of San Stefano to
the other powers in accordance with the peremptory
demand of Beaconsfield, and held on her
course until the determined attitude assumed by
England forced her to modify her claims in
Europe.</p>

<p>Although we did not know all this at that time,
yet we knew enough to realize that possibly we
might see the Russian troops very shortly under
quite different circumstances; and this reflection
lent piquancy to the situation.</p>

<p>We watched the Russians as they marched in
on parade and formed up in a great hollow square,
with General Melikoff and the headquarters staff
sitting on their horses inside it, and the imperial
standards of yellow silk embroidered with the
black eagles flaunting in the air.</p>

<p>Then at a given signal the massed bands of
all the regiments struck up the Russian national
anthem, and the huzzas of the soldiery were given
with a goodwill that showed how welcome was
the close of the campaign. Our troubles had
been severe enough in Erzeroum; but the sufferings
of the Russian army camped outside in the
snow transcended anything that we had undergone,
and General Melikoff told me himself that
he had lost 40 per cent. of his army from typhus
fever and exposure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>A cleric, or "pope," as he was called, who
accompanied the troops in the capacity of an
army chaplain, delivered an excited harangue,
declaring that the Almighty had given the soldiers
of the cross the victory over the infidels; and
then the men were dismissed from parade, and
allowed to go where they liked. Several carts
full of wine were brought in, and the champions
of Christendom embarked on a glorious carouse.</p>

<p>All the Turkish troops who were able to travel
had been sent away to Erzinghan or Baiburt
in order to make room for the Russian army;
but we still had about two thousand men in
hospital, and these it was impossible to remove,
so that Stoker, Denniston, and myself had plenty
of work before us. There was a great deal of
sickness among the poorer Armenians in the
town, and these unfortunate creatures were almost
entirely dependent upon us for medical aid; so
it may readily be guessed that we had our
hands full.</p>

<p>On the day after the review General Melikoff
invited Stoker, Denniston, and myself to call on
him. Piloted by our excellent friend Captain
Pizareff, who was the general's aide-de-camp,
we found our way to headquarters, and were
introduced to the Russian field-marshal in the
big house which he had selected for his residence.</p>

<p>General Melikoff at that time was a man of
striking appearance, and looked every inch a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
soldier. His tall, well knit figure, his aquiline
nose, and dark, flashing eyes marked him out
at once as a military leader. He received us
with the greatest courtesy, and told us that he
had heard how hard we had worked, not only
in aid of the sick and wounded soldiers, but also
in aid of the poverty-stricken civil population
of the town. He assured us of his sympathy,
and promised to do everything in his power to
help us, asking us to make any suggestions with
regard to improvements that might be desirable
in conducting the sanitation of the city, and
expressing his willingness to meet our views in
every way. Encouraged by the kindly and
considerate attitude of the general, I ventured
to approach him by letter a few days afterwards,
and once again my unfortunate deficiencies in the
matter of French exposed me to treatment which
I shall never believe was authorized by General
Melikoff.</p>

<p>Hussein Effendi, the Turkish principal medical
officer, was the original cause of the trouble; for
he ordered the wounded to be removed from
the English hospital and sent away when they
were in such a weak condition that many of
them died in consequence of this heartless treatment.
We reported the matter to Hakki Bey,
and Hussein Effendi was at once sent for; and
having no satisfactory explanation to give of
his conduct, was imprisoned. At the same time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
remembering General Melikoff's injunction that
I should let him know of anything that required
seeing to in the hospitals, I wrote to him
explaining the circumstances. The letter was
really the joint production of Denniston, Stoker,
and myself. We wrote it in the best French
that we could muster; and as there was no
cream-laid notepaper left in Erzeroum, we were
obliged to use the only kind of stationery
available, which happened to be a bit of blue
foolscap. We surveyed our joint production with
pardonable pride, and despatched it without delay
to General Melikoff. When next I saw the
unfortunate letter, it was in the hands of the
Russian consul, who had returned to Erzeroum
with the army of occupation, having left the town
in the first instance on the outbreak of hostilities.
He was a tall man, with a very pale face and a
thick black beard. His manners were in striking
contrast to those of the Russian officers
whom we had met, for he was an insolent fellow,
who had not wit enough to conceal the signs
that betokened an ignorant Jack-in-office unaccustomed
to mix with men of the world or in
polite society. This individual came to me next
day, holding in his hand my letter to General
Melikoff, which he flung in my face, remarking
at the same time that it was not usual to write to
a field-marshal of the Russian army on a dirty
bit of foolscap and in atrociously bad French. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
was relieved to find from Captain Pizareff, whom
I apprised of the circumstance, that such a
message was never sent by General Melikoff.
Probably the facts of the case were that Melikoff
handed the letter to this uncouth personage with
instructions to attend to the matter, and that the
Jack-in-office, annoyed by the duty, vented his
spite upon the writer.</p>

<p>We became very intimate with Captain Pizareff,
and also made the acquaintance of a number
of Russian officers, whom we invited round to
our quarters in the evenings.</p>

<p>We found ourselves much sought after by the
Russian officers; and, in fact, the English Consulate,
where we lived, became to all intents and
purposes a Russian club. It got to be quite the
thing for them to drop in during the evening;
and we occasionally gave little dinner parties,
which were much appreciated. Our house, furnished
as it was with Mr. Zohrab's excellent
supply of provisions, and with his admirable and
carefully selected stock of wines and liquors, was
the only place in Erzeroum where a decent
dinner was obtainable. An invitation to dine
with us was very acceptable, as may be imagined,
to these young Russian aristocrats, who had been
half starving in the snow for several months
past.</p>

<p>Most of those who came to us were friends
of Pizareff, who practically lived at our place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
He was a fine type of young fellow, with the
frank and dashing manner of the born soldier,
and with a nature widened and improved by
travel. Like my other great friend, poor Czetwertinski,
he was a brilliant horseman, and his
charger was the envy of the regiment. This
horse was an extremely handsome white stallion,
which, as the advertisements say, was formerly the
property of a gentleman, and had been parted
with simply because the owner had no further
use for him. The original owner happened to
be a notorious brigand in Daghistan, who for a
long time defied all efforts to capture him, but
was taken at last and summarily hanged. Pizareff
was offered enormous sums for this famous animal,
which added to his undoubted worth as a charger
something of the extrinsic sentimental value that
might have attached to Dick Turpin's Black
Bess.</p>

<p>Another charming man who used to come to
our house was the colonel commanding the Orenburg
Cossacks. We saw a great deal of him,
and also of his adjutant, Captain Anisimoff, who
spoke English like an Englishman, and looked
exactly like a British naval officer. They all
drank brandy at a rate that threatened to deplete
our stock of this medical comfort in an alarming
manner; and I remember that one evening a
party of them polished off three bottles between
them, which made me open my eyes, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
as brandy was worth two pounds a bottle in
Erzeroum at that time. One of the party was
a young Russian prince, whose name I have forgotten.
He had never tasted brandy before, and
was so proud of his achievement that he insisted
upon sending a telegram to his father at St. Petersburg
announcing that he had been drinking eau-de-vie
in Erzeroum at the house of three English
doctors&mdash;a highly important despatch from the
seat of war.</p>

<p>About this time I received a telegram one day
from Constantinople informing me that the Sultan
had been pleased to confer upon me the decoration
of the fourth order of the Medjidie in
recognition of my services. Mere lad as I was,
I felt very proud of my decoration, and Denniston,
Stoker, and myself had a great consultation about
the matter. They opined that there was only
one course open to me, and that it was incumbent
upon me to give a party in celebration of the
event. As the guests would be all Russians, I
felt bound in honour to do the thing properly,
and determined to go outside Mr. Zohrab's cellar
in order to provide materials befitting the occasion.
Mr. Zohrab had forgotten to lay in a stock of
champagne before he went, and it was clear that
champagne was the only liquor which would meet
the requirements of the case. Now I knew that
there was no champagne in Erzeroum before the
arrival of the Russians; but I guessed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
sutlers and purveyors who followed the Russian
army would not have forgotten to bring the wine
which is so much favoured in Russia. Old Tom
Rennison, a campaigner whose vast experience
enabled him to live in luxury in places where a
goat would starve, thought that he knew where
to get some "fizz"; so I despatched him to
bring in half a dozen bottles <i>coûte que coûte</i>.
Still, it was a bit staggering to find that, when
he brought back the required quantity, he also
had a little bill of eighteen pounds to render for
the half-dozen of Moet and Chandon which some
enterprising purveyor had carted on a sledge
over the snow from Tiflis, four hundred miles
away. About a dozen Russian officers came round
to my party, and we made a great night of it.
Denniston proposed my health in English, and I
responded in the same language. Then Pizareff
proposed it in French, and I made shift to reply
in that tongue. Some one else made a few
complimentary remarks in German, and several
speeches were added in Russian. Before the
evening was half over we were paying the most
extravagant compliments to each other, and I
have an indistinct recollection of trying somewhere
about midnight to teach a big, fair-bearded
captain "Auld lang syne," and to render "We
twa ha' paid'lt i' the burn" into my own peculiar
French, a task in which I was entirely unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>We had quite a number of little dinner parties
after this. One night General Komaroff, who
afterwards commanded the Russians at the
famous fight which goes down to history as the
"Pendjeh incident," invited us to dine with him;
and Stoker and I accepted, though Denniston
was sick and obliged to stay at home. The
general, who was then a young man, although
he wore a beard and spectacles, treated us very
hospitably, and had evidently spared no pains to
make the entertainment a success. A regimental
band stationed in the courtyard outside played
English airs as a compliment to the visitors;
and the <i>menu</i>, which began with a zacuska of
caviare and anchovies, was a capital one. A
small tumbler of raw absinthe was poured out
for each guest to begin with; and as they insisted
that I must drink mine in spite of all my protestations,
I was nearly poisoned. Later on English
bottled stout was served round gravely in wine
glasses. How on earth it got to Erzeroum I
could not make out, for the Russians do not
drink stout; but it was evidently intended as
a compliment to us, so I tossed mine down,
much wondering.</p>

<p>Captain Pizareff, who lived in General Melikoff's
house, asked me to go round and dine with him
one night as the general was going out, and
with great thoughtfulness my host sent round
a Cossack with a spare horse for me. We had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
capital dinner; but the only thing to drink was
a big stone bottle full of Benedictine, which we
finished between us. Pizareff was equal to the
emergency. Late at night he sent me back to
my own quarters with my Cossack guard doubled.
I had a Cossack riding on each side of me to hold
me on. They were jolly, good-humoured fellows,
clad in heavy sheepskin overcoats; and they
laughed immoderately every time I fell off my
horse, which occurred three times during the
journey of about a mile. On each of these
occasions, as I sat disconsolately in the frozen
snow, a melancholy figure in a long overcoat,
boots, and spurs, and a sword which insisted in
getting between my legs, my Cossacks replaced
my fez on my head, deftly disentangled me from
my sword, and hoisted me once more into the
saddle. In spite of the terrible stories that one
hears about them sometimes, I shall always have
a warm corner in my heart for Cossacks.</p>

<p>Although we got on capitally with the Russian
officers, the rank and file of the army of occupation
behaved very badly to the few unfortunate
Turkish soldiers who were left behind to recover
from their wounds when the bulk of the sufferers
were sent away. Whenever the Russian linesmen
came across these poor devils crawling about
the streets, they would jeer them and mock them
first, and then beat them cruelly. I have seen
half a dozen Russians attack a couple of wretchedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
weak and emaciated Turks who were painfully
creeping along the street, and kick them brutally,
leaving them half dead by the side of the road.</p>

<p>Once Denniston, Stoker, and myself had a
narrow escape. We had gone for a walk by
ourselves outside of the town proper towards the
redoubts, when we came upon a party of Russian
infantrymen who were undisguisedly hostile.
One fellow came up to me, said something in
Russian, and then hit me a crack over the head
which annoyed me so much that I went for him
with my fists. Denniston and Stoker sailed in at
the others; but the soldiers had their side arms
with them, and it would have fared badly with
us but for the sudden appearance of a Russian
captain, who saw the affair, and came running to
our assistance, revolver in hand. He knocked
down my assailant with the pistol-butt for a start,
and discharged such a volley of remarks at the
others that they slunk off like beaten curs. We
were grateful for his timely intervention, without
which we would probably have been killed outright;
and we paid due attention to his warning
that it was dangerous to come unprotected so
far from the town.</p>

<p>The comfort in which we lived at the consulate
had not escaped the envy of some of the
Russians, and one man in particular was consumed
with jealousy when he saw the fine
house in which we were quartered. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
General Heymann, who commanded the Russian
column of assault at Devoi Boyun, and showed
conspicuous bravery during the engagement. In
fact, he was generally spoken of afterwards as
the hero of Devoi Boyun. It seemed that about
twenty years before the war he had been in
Erzeroum, and had occupied the house, which
was afterwards turned into the English Consulate.
During the long months of discomfort while
the army was encamped in the stinking little
villages outside Erzeroum, General Heymann
had buoyed himself up with the hope that as
soon as the inevitable occupation arrived he
would go back to his old quarters again; and
when at last he got into the town, he was disgusted
to find the house upon which he had
set his heart in the occupation of some English
doctors. His first move was to send an aide-de-camp
to us with a request that we would
vacate the house, which we at once declined
to do. Then the trouble began. Although
the fascinating pursuit of "draw poker" is not
practised to any great extent in Russia, still that
aide-de-camp was fully conversant with one of
its leading features, and he set himself to play
the game of bluff with great vigour. He began
to bluster in great style, hoping that I would
throw up my hand at once; but I went one
better every time. At last he remarked that
might was right, that the Russians were an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
army of occupation, and that if we did not go
out of our house we would be turned out. I
said that we certainly would not go unless turned
out by force, and that as the Russian troops
occupied the town under the terms of an armistice,
and not as a consequence of a successful assault,
they could not disturb us in our quarters. I
closed the conversation by saying that if they
turned Denniston, Stoker, and myself out of
our house, I would telegraph to Lord Derby
requesting him to make representations at St.
Petersburg on the subject. Then I bowed out
General Heymann's aide-de-camp. Next day,
however, a communication arrived from the
konak announcing that the general insisted that
we should be turned out, and that the civil
authorities of the town would be glad if we
would leave quietly. This was rather too much,
and I went up to the konak next day, taking
Tom Rennison as an interpreter. I was shown
into a room where Hakki Bey, the civil governor,
and a number of Turkish and Armenian officials
were discussing the situation. Here I stood up
and made a speech, which was interpreted as I
went along by Tom Rennison. I told them that
we had come out there to help their sick and
wounded, that two of our number had already
died in their cause, and that the rest of us had
risked our lives for them over and over again.</p>

<p>"We have done all this for you," I said; "we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
have cared for your wounded, and eased their
sufferings; we have tended your sick, and sent
them food and wine from our own table; and
now, you ungrateful beggars, you want to turn us
out of our own house. Well, we won't go." They
listened very courteously to my exordium, which
was translated into Turkish by the faithful
Rennison; and when it was finished, I could
see that I had made an impression. Our eviction
was no longer insisted upon, and General
Heymann had to content himself with a large
house immediately opposite our quarters.</p>

<p>Some little time after this the French consul,
M. Jardin, approached us, and used his influence
with us, asking us if possible to humour the
old general by granting his wish. Finally we
agreed to do so, and I wrote a letter to General
Heymann, saying that as a personal compliment
to his excellency we would give him up the house.
At the same time I warned him that there would
be a risk attached to his occupancy, as we had
had several cases of typhus in the house. He
came over the same afternoon in great glee,
bringing his dragoman with him to thank us,
as he himself spoke nothing but Russian. He
said that, being an old campaigner, he had no
fear of typhus; and he marked his appreciation
of the favour shown to him by presenting us
with a box of four hundred cigars, which were
most acceptable. Next day he sent us twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
soldiers to remove our baggage to the house
which he was giving up; and when the moving
was accomplished he entered into possession of
the consulate. He went to bed feeling poorly
on the very day that he got into his new quarters,
and four days afterwards he was dead of typhus.
Denniston, Stoker, and I all attended the poor
old fellow's funeral, wondering at the strange
fate that had allowed him to live through many
a hard-fought fight only to let him die in his bed
when the campaign was over.</p>

<p>While the Turks and Armenians in Erzeroum
were dying by hundreds from typhus, the Russian
soldiers also suffered severely; and as I went
round the town, I found many of them lying sick
and untended, not from any want of care on the
part of the Russian doctors, but simply because
the soldiers stole away and hid themselves when
they fell ill.</p>

<p>Captain Pizareff would not believe it when I
told him that his men were dying like sheep, and
declared that it was impossible for such a thing
to happen without the knowledge of the colonel
of the regiment. In order to convince the aide-de-camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
I asked him to go with me and see
the state of things with his own eyes.</p>

<p>Next morning I started out early to visit a
poor Armenian woman whose child had been
accidentally scalded, and I took Captain Pizareff
with me. The woman lived in a miserable
quarter of the town, inhabited only by the poorest
people; and evidences of distress and semi-starvation
were present on every hand. I found
my patient easily enough; and after dressing
the injuries of the scalded child, I took Pizareff
on a tour of inspection down the street. The
snow was piled high round the walls of the
first dilapidated, tumble-down shanty that we
entered; and at first, as we went inside out of the
strong glare of the sun on the snow, we could
hardly see at all. A small latticed window near
the roof admitted a few gleams of light; and as
our eyes became accustomed to the semi-obscurity,
we could make out three Russians lying on a
heap of straw in a corner of the room. They
were all down with typhus. One was lying on
his back, with his eyes wide open, staring at the
ceiling. As we entered he looked at us, and
seemed to recognize Pizareff. He made a feeble
effort to rise from the straw and lift his hand in
the military salute; but the strain was too much
for him, and he fell back exhausted. The other
two men were moaning and tossing from side
to side, calling at intervals for water. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Armenian child about seven years old was
playing with a dog in the snow which lay thickly
in the yard at the back of the house. While I
was looking at the men, the child came to the
door, peered curiously in, and then returned unconcernedly
to his game in the yard. The sight
of sickness and death was not sufficiently novel
to disturb the amusement of the moment.</p>

<p>In several other houses in the same street
similar scenes were met with; and in one an
Armenian family consisting of a father, mother,
and three children were unconcernedly eating
their dinner&mdash;a bowl of grain boiled into a kind
of sticky porridge&mdash;while the corpse of a Russian
soldier who had just died lay on the floor in the
next room.</p>

<p>Captain Pizareff was petrified with astonishment,
and reported the circumstances to General
Melikoff at once. I sent word to the Russian
Red Cross doctors, and they despatched a party
of ambulance men to collect their sick and bring
them into the hospitals. How it was possible
for the absence of the men from roll call to
remain unnoticed I cannot understand; but I
heard afterwards that the colonel of the regiment
to which these unfortunates belonged got into
serious trouble over it.</p>

<p>Denniston, Stoker, and myself found plenty of
work to do among the Russian sick as well as
among our own men, and were glad to lend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Russian doctors our assistance. We found our
Russian <i>confrères</i> capital fellows, and also excellent
surgeons. They had worked on bravely
while their army was outside Erzeroum and
afterwards at Kars, though their resources were
severely taxed by the number of the wounded at
Devoi Boyun, as well as by the fevers and frostbite
that decimated the troops during the long
intervals between the different engagements.</p>

<p>They spoke of General Melikoff in terms of
the highest admiration, praising his administrative
ability as well as his military capacity; and I felt
that their opinions were well founded, when I
reflected upon the difficulties under which he had
laboured, especially in the transport and commissariat
department. On one occasion General
Melikoff said to me himself, "I am prouder of
having been able to feed my army than I am
of any of my victories." When it is remembered
that everything in the shape of supplies, including
provisions and medical stores, had to be brought
over the snow from Tiflis, four hundred miles
away, it will be conceded that the general's
pride in his achievement was justified. General
Melikoff was most appreciative of our medical
services on behalf of his troops, and told us on
one occasion that he would recommend us for
decorations at the hands of the Russian Government.
However, during the anxious political
times which ensued the Russian Government had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
something else to think about besides the services
of three unknown English doctors in far away
Erzeroum, and the decorations never came.</p>

<p>Gladly and willingly as I gave my services in
the cause of humanity, it was nevertheless a real
pleasure to find that they were appreciated by the
Russian troops as well as by the Stafford House
Committee, and also the Turkish Government.
Captain Morisot, who returned to Erzeroum from
Constantinople, brought me up, not only fresh
supplies of money, but also the news that the
Stafford House Committee had passed a special
vote of thanks to myself and the other doctors
of the Erzeroum section. The document setting
forth this vote of thanks, signed by the Duke
of Sutherland as chairman of the committee, is
couched in most complimentary terms; and, needless
to say, it forms one of my most cherished
mementoes of the war. Similar special votes of
thanks were accorded to Dr. Stiven and Dr.
Beresford for their great bravery during the
fighting at Rustchuk. I had already received
the fourth order of the Medjidie, and to this
the Turkish Government were afterwards pleased
to add the fourth order of the Osmanli and also
the Turkish war medal.</p>

<p>We were reinforced during March by the arrival
of Dr. Roy and a party of doctors sent out by
the Red Cross Society. They had undergone a
good deal of hardship since they left Constantinople,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
and one of their number, a Dane named
Price, had died. I shall always remember Roy
through a remarkable incident of which I was
informed by him some time after I had left
Erzeroum. In my quarters I was accustomed
to sleep on the floor on a mat, and even in a
besieged town I had kept up the early habit of
reading in bed. The usual military candlestick
was a bayonet, which was stuck in the floor, with
the candle jammed into the socket; but I found
a more convenient receptacle in a Turkish conical
shell, which I had picked up somewhere, and which
made a capital candlestick when the brass cap at
the end was unscrewed. Into the orifice of the
shell I stuck my candle every night, and read
<i>Vanity Fair</i>&mdash;which I got out of Mr. Zohrab's
capital library&mdash;for the first time. I never can
think of Becky Sharp to this day without a
shudder, not on account of her treatment of
Rawdon Crawley or her dubious relationship
with the Marquis of Steyne, but simply owing
to the circumstances under which I first met her.
She was certainly a risky acquaintance for me.
A week or two after I left Erzeroum my candlestick
fell into other hands, and one night it
exploded, fortunately in an empty room, which
it wrecked without damaging any one in the
house. My first introduction to Becky Sharp
was effected by the light of a candle stuck in
the mouth of a live shell!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>Powder was unnecessarily burnt more than
once during our last month in Erzeroum. One
night I was awakened by a terrific explosion,
and almost before I could collect my senses
a frantic knocking at the door showed that
somebody wanted the doctor in a hurry. We
all jumped into our clothes, and followed the
guide to a place where an Armenian house had
stood a few minutes before, but which when
we reached the spot was a mere heap of wreckage.
One of the few survivors explained what
had happened. He told us that a lot of
Armenians had got hold of some Turkish cartridges,
and were endeavouring to convert the
powder to their own use. Sixteen men were
sitting in a circle on their haunches in the
middle of a big room, busily pulling the bullets
out of the cartridges and emptying the powder
into a heap, which was gradually increasing in
size in the centre, when the desire for a cigarette
came upon one of them, and he struck a match.
The next instant the house was in the air, and
ten of the Armenians were in paradise&mdash;or
somewhere else. There was a good deal of
confusion in the darkness; but I recollect finding
myself down on my knees in a stable at the
back of the house examining two of the sufferers
who were still alive. One of them lay between
the legs of a cow, and while he was in that
position I dressed his injuries. The crowd had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
been very troublesome, and I had locked the
door of the stable on the inside to keep them
away, when I heard a tremendous hammering
and some one demanding admittance. I called
out that there was strictly no admittance; but
in a very few minutes a file of soldiers burst
the door in, and General Duhoffskoy, very angry
at being kept out in the cold, stood before me.
He was good enough to accept my apologies
when I explained why I had locked the door,
and also to thank me for attending to the sufferers.
General Duhoffskoy was appointed to act as a
kind of chief commissioner of police at Erzeroum
in addition to his military duties, and whenever
there was any excitement in the town he was
always on the spot. One night we had a very
big fire; in fact, half the street seemed to be
burning. There was plenty of water, however;
and if it had not been for the crowd, there
would have been no difficulty in extinguishing
the flames. An Armenian crowd at a fire is
very much like any other crowd, and the people
indulged in sudden stampedes and all sorts of
"alarums and excursions" to such a degree that
the work of the soldier firemen was greatly
hindered. General Duhoffskoy took in the situation
at a glance, and at once announced that
if the crowd did not disperse it would be blown
to pieces, as one of the burning houses contained
an enormous quantity of powder and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
explosives. The effect was instantaneous, and
the miscellaneous mass of Turks and Armenians
melted away as if by magic.</p>

<p>Soon after the return of Captain Morisot, I
received a telegram from the Stafford House
Committee saying that we had done enough
for honour and glory, and that we had better
go back to Constantinople, as the Turkish administration
was able to cope with all the hospital
work that remained to be done in Erzeroum.
I was instructed to place the balance of our
medical stores at the disposal of the Turks
before leaving, and accordingly I handed everything
over to Hakki Bey, receiving a receipt,
and also a grateful acknowledgment of our
services to the Turkish troops, together with a
special letter for presentation to the Seraskierat.</p>

<p>My last week in Erzeroum was a busy one,
as we had to make extensive preparations for
the journey to Trebizond, which was quite a
formidable undertaking. I had collected a great
deal of personal baggage during my travels, and
our equipment was considerable; so I arranged
with a Persian caravan which was going down
to Trebizond for the conveyance of the heaviest
of our impedimenta, retaining only my valuables
and the curios which I had got together to
take down under my own supervision with the
caravan. There were many Persians in Erzeroum,
and as a rule they got on very well with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Turks, though occasionally racial antipathy was
responsible for those minor persecutions known
as practical jokes, of which the Turks were
very fond. One day in the hammam, or
Turkish bath, I met an old Persian, who was
in a deplorable state of grief in consequence of
the treatment which he had received from two
young Turks. The Persians all grew very long
beards, of which they were inordinately proud,
and they were accustomed, after coming out of
the bath, to dye them a fine rich brickdust colour
with henna. One never saw a Persian with a
white beard. Now this particular old Persian
had carefully rubbed his beard with henna, in
blissful ignorance of the fact that two mischievous
young Turks had been to his henna-pot
and had mixed a quantity of corrosive acid with
the dye. The consequence was that when the
Persian applied the dye the beard came away in
pieces, and left the poor man beardless in his old
age and disgraced.</p>

<p>On the day before we left Erzeroum I called
on General Duhoffskoy, as the military governor
of the town, in order to obtain from him a pass
through the Russian lines and the necessary
papers authorizing my departure. The general
was a distinguished-looking man of about forty
years of age, and he received me very courteously,
expressing polite regret at my departure, and
promising to facilitate my journey as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
possible. It struck me that I had never seen him
in such good spirits before, and that there was a
beam of sunshiny contentment in his face, which
was an agreeable change from the rigid military
look of his usually stern features. As I was
inwardly wondering what could have happened
to effect this change, the door opened, and a
lady entered the room. "Permit me to present
you to my wife, Dr. Ryan," said the general;
and turning I bowed, there in remote, snow-clad,
devastated Erzeroum, to one of the most
beautiful women I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Princess Duhoffskoy, <i>née</i> Princess Galitzin, was
then about twenty years of age, and to my youthful
imagination, with her beautifully chiselled
features, complexion of exquisite fairness, and
large blue eyes that looked me frankly in the
face, she seemed like a visitant from another
world. For a year and a half almost the only
specimens of womanhood that I had seen were
squat and swarthy Bulgarian girls, frowsy
Armenians, or Turkish women closely veiled in
their yashmaks. It was no wonder that this
lovely Russian, with her delicate, refined beauty
and her frank and gracious manner, made a profound
impression upon me, and set my heart
beating quickly with mingled surprise and delight.</p>

<p>The general returned to his writing-table, and
I was left to talk to this beauteous vision alone.
I stammered a few remarks in execrable German;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
for though I spoke that language fairly fluently
on ordinary occasions, my sensations drove my
vocabulary out of my head, and I felt that for one
in my position at any rate the resources of that
grave and elephantine tongue were exasperatingly
inadequate.</p>

<p>"Oh, Doctor Ryan, would you not prefer to
speak English?" said the Princess, to my intense
astonishment, without the least trace of a foreign
accent. Like many cultured Russians, she had
learnt to speak English as well as French and
German when a child; and she soon showed me
that she could not only talk, but talk interestingly,
in my own language. In her lips the Doric
harshness of sound in spoken English disappeared,
and the well known words took on something of
the smooth, musical cadence of the softer Italian.
She told me that she had only reached Erzeroum
on the previous day, after travelling four hundred
miles across the snow from Tiflis to join her
husband, and she chatted away pleasantly of the
incidents which occurred on the way as if there
was nothing unusual in a delicately nurtured lady
going through the hardships necessitated by
such a journey in a sleigh. She expressed great
interest in my work among the wounded, and
listened attentively while I spoke of the bravery
of the Turkish troops and their fortitude under
pain. When I told her of an Anatolian Turk
who died in my hospital at Plevna with his wife's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
name on his lips, the beautiful eyes of this Russian
princess filled with tears. "Poor fellow," she
whispered softly; "I hope it is not wrong for us
to pity the sufferings of the enemy."</p>

<p>Coffee was brought in, and I sat there for
about two hours chatting with the princess, while
the general continued writing at his table.
Every now and then he looked up with a glance
which seemed to say, "Not gone yet? I wonder
how much longer this confounded Englishman
is going to stay." At last I managed to tear
myself away, and I said good-bye to this beautiful
Russian lady, with many regrets that I had
to leave Erzeroum next day. I never saw her
again; but when I got back to the consulate, I
selected about fifty standard English books from
Mr. Zohrab's excellent library, packed them on
a little sleigh, and despatched them to Princess
Duhoffskoy with my card, presenting my compliments,
and hoping that the books would lessen
the tedium of her stay in such a dull place
as Erzeroum. General Duhoffskoy is now the
governor of a province in Siberia, where he
resides with his beautiful wife, whose visit to
Erzeroum was the one gleam of real sunshine
that I had seen throughout that terrible winter.</p>

<p>Before we started for Trebizond, a slight
difference of opinion arose between myself and
my comrades, Denniston and Stoker, upon a
matter affecting our joint interest. It did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
in the least disturb the friendly relations existing
between us, and I only mention the matter now
because it was all my fault that my companions
were induced to assent to incurring the responsibility
and inconvenience of escorting another
traveller to Trebizond&mdash;and that traveller a
lady.</p>

<p>M. Jardin, the French consul, was a true
Frenchman of the best type, agreeable, polite,
and above all things always anxious to oblige
a lady. Accordingly, when he came to me with
a pathetic appeal on behalf of a charming Spanish
widow, whose husband had been an apothecary
attached to the medical staff I found the greatest
difficulty in turning a deaf ear to him. He
explained to me that the beautiful Spaniard
was most anxious to get to Constantinople, where
she had friends who would arrange for her
passage back to her own country, and that he
would take it as a personal favour to him if we
would allow the lady to join our party.</p>

<p>I foresaw the inconvenience of taking a lady
on an extremely rough journey, which had to be
accomplished entirely on horseback, over mountain
tracks and passes deep in snow; so at first I gave
a polite refusal to the French consul's request.
But M. Jardin would not be denied. He minimized
the difficulties of the journey, which
he assured us would be nothing to such courageous
and experienced men as ourselves. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
extolled us for the services which we had already
rendered in the cause of humanity, and he urged
us not to decline at the last moment to still
further add to our laurels in this direction.
Finally he dwelt at great length upon the grace
and beauty of this dark-eyed Spanish lady, whom
none of us had ever seen, and he painted the
despair with which she looked forward to the
prospect of remaining widowed and alone in
Erzeroum, perhaps to die, far from her country
and from her own people. What could I say
in answer to such an appeal? What could I
do? There was nothing for it but to submit
with some misgiving to the inevitable; and
accordingly I informed M. Jardin that I would
withdraw my own objections, and would consent
to the arrangement if he could prevail upon
Denniston and Stoker to agree also.</p>

<p>If M. Jardin had not been an exceedingly
decorous as well as polite Frenchman, I feel sure
he would have jumped with joy when I capitulated,
and he went off forthwith to interview
Denniston and Stoker. What occurred at that
interview I cannot precisely say, because both
my comrades were strangely reticent upon the
subject. I conjecture, however, that M. Jardin
praised their courage and their chivalry in a
truly generous spirit, and I am convinced that
he dwelt with all his astonishing eloquence upon
the grace and loveliness of this poor Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
beauty in distress. At any rate, Denniston and
Stoker agreed to let her travel with us.</p>

<p>Just before we started, and when the pack-horses
upon which we were to ride to Erzeroum
were at the door, M. Jardin brought up his
beautiful Spaniard and introduced her to us.
I hope I shall not be considered impolite when
I confess that our jaws all dropped simultaneously.
No doubt the lady had been beautiful
in her youth; but her particular style of beauty
had not been proof against the devastating power
of years, and I doubt whether any man in
Erzeroum, except that very polite French consul,
would have seen extraordinary loveliness in the
lady who was handed over to our care at the
very last moment. However, there was nothing
for it but to hoist her upon a pack-saddle, to
mount ourselves upon similar uncomfortable seats,
and to start the melancholy procession. We
said good-bye with real regret to Pizareff, who
had been a capital friend and a most charming
and genial companion. Fully thirty or forty other
Russian officers came to see us off, and we parted
on the very best of terms. They told us laughingly
that they intended to drop in upon the
British army in India some day, and we assured
them that we would be there to meet them
when they came. Then we waved our last
adieux, and turned the heads of those long-suffering
pack-horses towards Trebizond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Our party consisted of Denniston, Stoker,
Morisot, myself, and Williams our trusty dragoman,
while last, but not least, came the lady.
We had hired twelve horses to carry ourselves
and our baggage, contracting to pay the headman
of the caravan four pounds per horse for the
journey to Trebizond; and accordingly when we
started we formed an important section of the
whole caravan of about fifty horses which set out
from Erzeroum. Besides the headman, who was
a most forbidding-looking Persian, there were
fifteen drivers who accompanied us; each, I think,
dirtier, hungrier, and more truculent-looking than
the other. We guessed when we started that
the journey would not be exactly a pleasure
excursion; but the reality far exceeded our anticipations,
and the next time that any one asks
me to make an overland journey with a widow,
a still small voice within will whisper, "Beware!
Remember Erzeroum and the Spanish doña."</p>

<p>Riding on a pack-saddle, which consists of two
plates of hard wood joined by hinges at the apex
where it fits over the horse's spine, is not the
most agreeable way of taking horse exercise;
and the doña, who was necessarily riding <i>en
cavalier</i>, began to give tongue before she had
gone a hundred yards. We made a cushion out
of an old sack filled with hay, and our incubus
heaved a sigh of relief when we placed it between
her ill used anatomy and the bare boards which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
she bestrode. Then the procession went forward
again, the horses stepping out in single file on
the first stage of the long journey of one hundred
and eighty miles that lay between us and the sea.</p>

<p>We left Erzeroum on March 31, intending to
catch the Messageries steamer <i>Simois</i>, which was
due to leave Trebizond on April 10, and fancying
that by giving ourselves ample time we would
have three or four days in Trebizond to recruit
before going on board. However, we reckoned
without our host, or on this occasion, to speak
more accurately, without our guest&mdash;the lady.
She spoke every continental language except
English with equal facility, and her vocabulary in
each was surprisingly extensive. Day and night
for one consecutive fortnight her shrill falsetto
voice poured forth a never failing stream of complaint
and invective, abuse and lamentation in
half a dozen languages. What she suffered no
one knew except herself, although this was not
her fault, to be sure, for she lost no opportunity of
imparting the information, sometimes in Spanish,
and when she had exhausted the resources of
that noble language in the slang of half the
capitals of Europe. We found too late that our
doña had not been cast in the heroic mould.
She had never learnt how beautiful it is to suffer&mdash;and
be silent.</p>

<p>A few miles from Erzeroum we came to the
village of Ilidja, which was occupied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
Russians; and there we halted for half an hour,
and had a glass of wine with a party of jovial
officers, who were keeping up their spirits as
well as they could in the lonely, God-forsaken
place. On a dunghill in the village we counted
eleven dead Russians; so we guessed that the
typhus was not confined to Erzeroum.</p>

<p>When we got to Purnekapan, we camped for
the night in the town, intending to make an early
start, so as to negotiate the Kopdagh Pass before
the sun spoiled the road. An unexpected difficulty,
however, presented itself, for our Persian
headman refused to go on, declaring that it was
necessary to rest his horses for a day. In vain
did we cojole, threaten, or bully him. He had
come under the spell of a fixed idea, and nothing
that we could say seemed to have the slightest
effect upon his diseased intelligence. But at
last I found a way to move him. There was a
Turkish regiment in the village, and I sought
an interview with the colonel, who had heard
something about our work, and was very well
disposed towards us. Tapping the butt of his
revolver significantly, he suggested to the Persian
that it was high time to start, and the hint was
accepted with alacrity. However, all this had
taken time, and before we left the foot of the
mountain and began the ascent it was eleven
o'clock, and the sun's rays were ruining the track.</p>

<p>It was as exciting a bit of mountaineering as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
I have ever gone through, and we had to strain
every nerve to climb the pass. In many places
the track was only a couple of feet wide, a
winding path cut round the side of the mountain,
with a cliff on one side and a precipice on the
other. As we mounted slowly and cautiously up
the path, every nerve was at tension and every
sense on the alert. Now and then, as the Persian
drivers shouted and urged the frightened horses
with voice and whip to face the slippery rising
ground, one of the animals would slip, and for a
second or two one's heart was in one's mouth.
In spite of every effort we lost three pack-horses
before we won the summit. A slip on the glassy
surface, a couple of frightened plunges in the
loose snow near the edge, and then the unfortunate
creatures disappeared over the side,
falling upon a lower spur four hundred feet
beneath us. One of the horses that we lost in
this way was loaded with my personal effects.
The presents that I was taking back to my
friends, some beautiful turquoises from the Tiflis
mines, as well as the Russian furs, the Russian
leather cigar-cases, and the other keepsakes that
the warm-hearted officers in Erzeroum had given
me, all vanished with that hapless pack-horse
into some inaccessible ravine far below the
Kopdagh peak. However, all the Persian drivers
came through safely, and there were no missing
faces in our party when we reached the summit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
nine thousand feet above the level of the sea.
The widow was still with us, numbed with the
cold, exhausted with fatigue, and half shaken to
death on her pack-saddle, but voluble as ever,
and, like the person in the Greek play, "full of
groans and not devoid of tears."</p>

<p>Just as we neared the summit I saw a Turkish
woman climbing slowly and painfully up the
track; but when we got to the shelter-house
erected on the crest of the mountain, I lost sight
of her. As we resumed our march, I noticed
tracks in the snow in front of us, and drew the
attention of Williams the dragoman to the impressions
which had evidently been made by a
woman. The dragoman disappeared for ten
minutes on a tour of exploration, and when he
returned he brought back a strange piece of
intelligence. A Turkish baby had been born in
a shed near the shelter-house while we were there,
and the mother, whom we had seen climbing the
pass, was already walking off with her newborn
infant to her own village five miles away across
the snow. Surely the cares of maternity lie
lightly on those hardy Turkish mothers in the
mountains of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>As may be guessed, we found a good deal of
difficulty in replenishing our commissariat during
this eventful journey. The Turkish troops had
pretty well swept the board; and if the villagers
had not hidden away some of their scanty stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
from the foraging parties, we should have come
off very badly. We managed to get eggs occasionally
<i>en route</i>, and onions were also obtainable.
I used to stuff my pockets with these delicacies
and munch them raw. I found them very sustaining,
and I have no doubt that my companions
when they ventured near me could testify that
my diet was strong. When we reached the
village at the foot of the Kopdagh where we
were to camp for the night, we were all ravenously
hungry, and as I shot a keen glance round the
village in search of supplies I espied a kid. It
was a very nice-looking kid, and it frisked and
gambolled most alluringly. I slipped off my pack-horse,
and approached the kid in a friendly manner
that disarmed suspicion. Then I grabbed it by
the ear, drew my big clasp knife, and cut its
throat on the spot. I skinned it and cleaned it
with my own experienced hands, and Williams
the dragoman made an excellent <i>ragoût</i>. I gave
the owner of the kid a Turkish lira as compensation
for his loss, which was truly our gain,
for the kid was a succulent little creature, and
tasted very much like venison.</p>

<p>We could not have travelled fast under the
most favourable conditions, and hampered as we
were by the Spanish widow our progress became
very slow indeed. It was not an easy task, even
for one accustomed to riding, to remain on the
wooden pack-saddle when a rough horse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
plunging about in the snow; but for the Spanish
widow it was literally impossible&mdash;a fact which she
demonstrated by falling off five times during the
journey over the Kop. It always happened in
the same way. The hind legs of her pack-horse
would slip down in the loose snow up to the hocks,
while the fore feet remained steady for just one
second on a harder patch, so that the animal's
back described an angle of forty-five degrees
with the surface of the ground. During that
one second the widow seized the opportunity of
slipping off backwards over the horse's tail; and
so quickly did she accomplish the feat that the
watchful Williams, whom I specially told off, much
to his disgust, to look after her, only arrived in
time to pick her up. The sight of that middle-aged,
sallow-faced Spanish person, in short skirts
and blue goggles, sitting helplessly in the snow
while Williams patiently collected her once more,
would have made us laugh heartily were it not
for the "damnable iteration" of the occurrence.</p>

<p>The presence of the widow caused us much
annoyance whenever we camped for the night,
because sleeping accommodation was usually
scanty, and we always had to find a room for
the lady before we turned in ourselves. Once,
when we reached the village where we were going
to camp for the night, we found that there were
only two sleeping-rooms available for the whole
party, so that we had to give one to the widow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
and camp&mdash;all five of us&mdash;in the other. First we
showed the lady to her apartment, and then we
went to look at our own. It was not a cosy
bedroom, with French bedsteads, dimity curtains
on the windows, and roses creeping up the walls
outside. On the contrary, it was a small, square
room, that would have made an excellent dog-kennel.
The floor was of mud, and in a corner
there was a heap of dirty straw, on which lay two
dead Turkish soldiers who had died of confluent
small-pox. We put the bodies outside the house,
and Denniston, Stoker, Morisot, and myself, with
Williams the dragoman, all went to sleep on the
straw.</p>

<p>As we travelled along day after day the glare
on the snow was very trying to the eyes; and
though we all wore blue goggles, we suffered a
good deal of inconvenience, while our faces were
dreadfully blistered by the sun. The Persian
headman was always wanting to stop and rest
his horses; so that what with perpetually working
at him to keep him up to the mark, pacifying the
Spanish widow, and foraging for our daily bread,
we had plenty of occupation <i>en route</i>. All our
drivers of course were eager to rob us whenever
the opportunity offered; and in addition to the
furs and turquoises which I had already lost
through a pack-horse going over the precipice, I
was also deprived of two very fine cats from the
province of Van. I had purchased these creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
which were very much like Persian cats, in
Erzeroum, and I had hired a pack-horse specially
to carry them. They were transported in a wooden
box fixed to the pack-saddle, and Williams fed
them with milk whenever we halted at a village.
A couple of days before we reached Trebizond,
however, my beautiful cats disappeared; and the
only consolation that was vouchsafed me for my
bereavement was the vague lie of a Persian driver,
who averred that they had escaped from their
box during the night. Of course he had planted
them somewhere for subsequent conversion into
ill gotten piastres.</p>

<p>When we commenced to get down towards
Trebizond, we left the snow behind us on the
mountains, and entered a tract of well timbered
country, which was looking its best in the first
flush of the early spring. The sides of the hills
were gorgeous with pink cyclamen, and with a
beautiful blue bulb which I could not identify.
At last we entered the avenue of pear trees
which were laden with juicy fruit when I passed
up to Erzeroum six months previously. When
I retraced my steps to Trebizond with new companions,
I found the pear trees in full bloom.
Since I had seen them bending under the burden
of the ripening fruitage, fire and sword and frost
and fever had brought many hundreds of men to
death before my eyes, and I myself had been
down to the very borders of the Valley of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Shadow. But now the war was over, the winter
was done, and the scent of the white pear blossoms
that filled all the valley blended with the first
faint fragrance of the breezes from the ever
nearing waters of the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Trebizond at last!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>We had time to call on Mr. Biliotti again, and
to thank him for all his kindness; and then we
went on board the <i>Simois</i>, which was ready to
cast off her moorings and head out for Constantinople.
Our Spanish widow was consistent
to the last. The real hardships of the journey
had not improved her temper; and when we
resolutely declined to pay her passage to Constantinople
in the steamer, she cursed us up
and down Trebizond, each and severally, with
the comprehensive particularity that was devoted
to the historic cursing of the Jackdaw of Rheims.
She was indeed that rare&mdash;or somewhat rare&mdash;phenomenon,
an ungrateful woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>When we reached Constantinople the whole
place was full of excitement, for the Russian army
was at San Stefano, only a few miles away,
and Pera was almost like a Russian town.
Every day hundreds of Russians might be seen
clanking up and down the streets in full uniform,
when they came in on leave from San Stefano.</p>

<p>English philanthropy was displayed as generously
at this stage as it had been throughout
the entire course of the war, and English gold
was freely spent on the relief of starving and
fever-stricken refugees from the Turkish provinces
as well as on the sick and wounded
troops. We got into touch with the philanthropic
scheme undertaken by the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts, who had sent out a large sum
of money for the relief of the refugees; and
we also met Mr. William Ashmead-Bartlett,
the administrator of the fund, who afterwards
married the baroness. He was ill with typhoid
fever contracted from some of the refugees, and
was under treatment at the English hospital,
where his brother (now Sir Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett)
was looking after him. Denniston,
Stoker, and I paid a visit of inspection to the
temporary hospitals established with the money
supplied by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and
furnished a report upon them.</p>

<p>It is to Sir Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett that I owe
my first introduction to a very charming American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
lady, who has since become known to a wide
circle through her career on the stage. When
I first met her she was an extraordinarily pretty
woman, and she and her husband were on their
honeymoon trip. He was a very gentlemanly
man, with a rather retiring disposition; while she
was about twenty years of age, and a perfect
model of youthful womanhood. Every glance
of her brightly flashing eyes and every line of
her finely moulded figure told of bounding life
and vivacity. Sir Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett and
I saw a good deal of her and her husband for
a week or two. We had lunch together often,
and took part in several picnics up the Bosphorus,
in that spring-time nineteen years ago, when
the blue waters of the strait and the bright
eyes of La belle Americaine laughed in harmony,
while Europe was waiting with beating
heart for the verdict&mdash;peace or war. I met
the B&mdash;&mdash; P&mdash;&mdash;s again on board the steamer
which took me away from Constantinople.
Then our paths in life divided, and I had almost
forgotten the vivacious American lady, when
one evening a year or two ago I dropped into
the Princess's Theatre in Melbourne to see
Sardou's great play <i>La Tosca</i>. In the actress
who was playing the name part I recognized
my acquaintance of the stirring times of the war.
It was Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; P&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Osman Pasha, who had been a prisoner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
war in Russia, had been sent back into Turkey
at the cessation of hostilities, and I went up to
call on him at the Seraskierat. He was never
a very communicative man, and the mental strain
which the magnificent defence of Plevna and
ultimately the tragic fall of the town imposed
upon him seemed to have deepened his natural
reserve. However, he gave me a hearty welcome,
and appeared to be much interested in my account
of our doings in Erzeroum. I told him that
if war broke out again on a larger scale than
before, I would return to my old comrades; and
I said that if I ever came back to Constantinople,
I would like to bring him a little present from
England. When I asked him what he would
choose, he said that there was nothing which
he would like so much as a real English saddle
and bridle. Osman Pasha was a thorough soldier
in his love for a first-class equipment, and I was
sorry that I never had the opportunity of seeing
him again to make him the present.</p>

<p>Dear old Hassib Bey, the principal medical
officer in Plevna, was quite affected when he
saw me again, and we had a great chat over
old times.</p>

<p>Tewfik Pasha, who was the Skobeleff of the
Turkish army, was living in a house at Galata,
and I went to call on him there. When I
entered the room, he was deeply moved, and
embraced me warmly. Tewfik was always in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
forefront of the battle while I was in Plevna;
and when the memorable attack was delivered
in which he recaptured the Krishin redoubts
from Skobeleff, it was Tewfik who headed the
column of assault and cheered the Turks on to
victory. He seemed to bear a charmed life; for
in spite of all the hot fighting that he had done,
he had come through the campaign without a
scratch. When I mentioned that he had been
extraordinarily lucky in all his fighting, he
motioned to his soldier servant who was in the
room to take down a big military paletot which
hung on the wall. The man took down the
overcoat which was the garment that Tewfik
Pasha had worn all through the siege. It was
fastened down the front with frogs instead of
buttons, and was provided with ample skirts
that would blow about in the wind when the coat
was not fastened securely. At Tewfik's request
I examined it, and counted no fewer than eleven
different bullet-holes through the cloth. In some
cases no doubt one bullet had made two holes;
but it was evident that on a good many different
occasions the gallant soldier who wore the
garment was literally within an inch of death.</p>

<p>Captain Morisot and I were invited to go to
dinner one day at San Stefano with a party
of Russian officers; but, much to my disappointment,
something interfered with the engagement,
and I missed the only chance I ever had of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
meeting the famous Skobeleff, who was then
quartered at the little port on the Dardanelles.
I found Morisot a delightful companion; and
now that we were not oppressed with hospital
duties, I had plenty of time to enjoy his society.
His career indeed was a most romantic and
interesting one. He had been shut up in Metz
with Bazaine during the Franco-Prussian war,
seven years earlier; and when the much criticised
marshal capitulated, Morisot became a prisoner of
war with the rest of the garrison, and was sent
away to Stettin on the Baltic. Though the
prisoners were carefully watched, Morisot, who
spoke English like an Englishman, managed to
arrange a plan of escape; and one dark night
he and another French officer eluded the guards,
and pulled out in a dingy to a small Scottish
schooner, trading between Glasgow and Stettin.
The skipper, who was a "braw mon fra Glasgie,"
and hated the Prooshians with a deep and deadly
hatred, received Morisot and his companion
with enthusiasm, and landed them after a fair
passage at Copenhagen, where they were given
quite an ovation. The Schleswig-Holstein affair
was still fresh in the minds of the Danes, and
they were delighted at the opportunity of doing
honour to men who had drawn the sword against
Germany. Morisot afterwards went to England;
and when the Russo-Turkish campaign broke
out, he hurried to Constantinople in search of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
further adventures. Animated as he was by the
true spirit of a soldier of fortune, Morisot found
a scope for his energies afterwards in the ideal
field of military adventure. "Ex Africa semper
aliquid novi," wrote an old historian; and the
dashing young Frenchman, recognizing the truth
of the remark even in these days, went to the
Cape.</p>

<p>A feeling was creeping over me that it was
high time I had a rest after all the storm and
stress of battle; and when a letter came to me
one day from my mother, who was in England,
I packed up my things on a sudden impulse
and stepped on board the Messageries steamer
<i>Gamboge</i>. Among my fellow passengers were
Mr. and Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; P&mdash;&mdash;, who were bound on
a trip through the Holy Land, and left us at
Smyrna. I also met again Admiral Sir William
Hewitt, who had entertained us on board his ship
the <i>Achilles</i> before I went to Erzeroum. He
and I occupied the same cabin on the voyage.</p>

<p>At Smyrna I found our old friend Mr. Zohrab
with his wife. Mrs. Zohrab was a dear, kind,
motherly Englishwoman; and when she saw me,
the thought of the sufferings that we had all gone
through in Erzeroum and the fate which had
fallen upon so many of the people whom she
knew quite overcame her. She flung her arms
round my neck, and burst into tears. Of course
Mr. Zohrab was very anxious to hear all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
had happened to us since he left Erzeroum, and
whether we were comfortable in the house that he
was obliged to desert. I told him that we did
full justice to his provisions and his wines; and
the expression of his face was quite pathetic
when I described the delightful little dinner
parties that we gave to the Russian officers out
of his ample stores. Poor old Zohrab! He
listened with much the same feelings that Ulysses
might have had when the island princes, over-bold,
were feasting on his substance and the steam
of the roasting beef (which the poet avers is dear
to the gods) rose up in his lordly halls.</p>

<p>Recollections of Osman Pasha's ball at Widdin
came back to me when I met at Smyrna Zara
Dilber Effendi, the skilful entertainer who arranged
all the details of that never to be forgotten
function. He and I spent the afternoon together,
and had much to tell each other. The sight of
this polished and dignified gentleman carried me
back to my first experiences in Turkey, and his
face was almost the last that I saw before I went
on board ship again, and said good-bye for ever
to that strange empire where the glow of romance
and chivalry and the pure flame of passionate
patriotism shone among the gathering shadows
that have since almost obscured the "light of
other days."</p>

<p>When I reached London, I found all England
ringing with the tidings of the fighting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
there were plenty of evidences of the interest
taken in the political situation. The music-halls,
where one may touch the pulse of popular feeling,
were crowded every night with audiences who
tumultuously applauded the patriotic ditties that
were encored over and over again, especially
the famous song which set forth that "The
Russians shall not have Constantino-o-ple."</p>

<p>I happened one night to stroll into the newly
built "Canterbury Theatre of Varieties," which,
by means of the novelty of a sliding roof, combined
with a programme illustrating scenes in
the campaign which was just concluded, drew
big crowds nightly. One of the items on the
programme was a realistic scene depicting the
taking of the Grivitza redoubt by the Russians,
and I watched the gallant "supers" with mingled
feelings as they charged home upon the cardboard
bayonets. The scene was capitally done,
and there was a prodigious expenditure of ammunition,
which the audience applauded mightily.
After the performance I sent my card round
to Mr. Villiers, who was the proprietor of the
show, intimating that I would like to see him.
A tall, rather good-looking man, in the elaborate
evening dress of a prosperous theatrical manager,
and wearing an enormous diamond in his shirt
front, made his appearance, and listened quietly
while I complimented him upon the realism
of the entertainment. I told him that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
really a very creditable show, but that there
were one or two points in which it might be
improved, and that, as I was the only Englishman
in Plevna during the attack, I could give
him some hints which would make the representation
more accurate historically, while at the
same time not impairing the spectacular effect.
Mr. Villiers, who, by the way, was the uncle of
my friend Fred Villiers, the war correspondent,
did not seem very enthusiastic. In fact, his
demeanour was distinctly discouraging. I felt
that he had something to say, and waited anxiously
for his answer. "Well, sir," he remarked, looking
me straight in the face while he twiddled his
heavy gold watch-chain, "I am not going to say
that I don't believe you; but you are the eleventh
man who has come round here with exactly
the same story." I was crushed, and bowed
myself out from the presence of the potentate,
almost wondering whether I really ever had been
to Plevna.</p>

<p>That there were plenty of impostors about, and
that Mr. Villiers had ample ground for being
suspicious of casual strangers professing to have
Turkish military experience, I soon discovered
for myself. I happened to be travelling up to
Scotland a couple of days afterwards, when a
gentlemanly looking individual got into the
smoking carriage with me, and we fell to chatting
upon the current topics of the day. The stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
began to interest me vastly, when he turned the
conversation dexterously into a discussion of the
Russo-Turkish campaign, and informed me that,
though an Englishman, he had served in the
artillery under Osman Pasha, and had been
present in Plevna during the siege. I let him
go on for fully a quarter of an hour recounting
his apocryphal exploits, and then I thought it
was time to speak. "Well, sir," I said, "it is a
most extraordinary thing to think that you could
have told that story to any other man in England
except myself, and he might have believed you."
I gave him my name, and told him that I knew
all the artillery officers in Plevna, and that he
certainly was not one of them. Never was an
unfortunate <i>raconteur</i> so non-plussed. He threw
up the sponge at once, and admitted that his
story was a fabrication suggested to him by the
fact that he had once made a holiday trip in
Turkey.</p>

<p>And now the close of the book is reached;
but before the last word is written, I should
like to express my profound admiration for the
soldierly qualities of the rank and file of the
Turkish army, with whom I lived on terms of
intimate companionship for nearly two years.
Courageous in misfortune, uncomplaining under
the most awful suffering, good-humoured in every
situation, the Turkish troops, both officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
men, showed throughout all the campaign the
temper of true heroes. I need hardly say that
for me it is deeply painful to think that the men
whom I almost idealized, the men with whom I
fought and suffered, with whom I tasted the glory
of victory and the bitterness of defeat, should
lie under the accusation of the atrocities which
we must believe have been committed in 1896,
not only in Armenia, but also in Constantinople.
Yet through the black cloud that hangs over
the Turkish Empire to-day I can still discern
the distant stars; for I can look back with honest
pride to the high sense of honour, the dauntless
courage, the loyalty and true patriotism of those
who were my comrades in arms in the earlier
and brighter days.</p>

ever published. The Russian figures far exceed those in the
text. The Russian losses, according to official enumeration,
were 22 officers killed and 52 wounded, and 2,771 men killed and
wounded; nearly two-thirds of the officers and over one-third of
the men were therefore <i>hors de combat</i>. Of the three colonels
commanding regiments two were killed; a general commanding
a brigade was wounded; of the six field officers present with
the 19th regiment two were killed and two wounded. Schilder-Schuldner's
force consisted of 6,500 men and 46 guns.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> According to Russian official statistics, the force brought against
Plevna numbered over 90,000 men, composed of 70,000 infantry,
10,000 cavalry, with 24 siege-guns, 364 field-guns, and 54 horse-guns.
The losses were in all 18,216 men: killed, 75 officers and
7,558 men; wounded, 290 officers and 10,658 men. The Turkish
strength given in the text is only approximate. The losses have
never been stated; Osman Pasha admitted after the surrender that
he lost more men on the Lovtcha road and its vicinity than did
Skobeleff, who owned to the loss of 160 officers and over 8,000 men.</p>
